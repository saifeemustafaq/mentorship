## About Virtual Machines :

Virtual machines are provided by many companies like Microsofts , Amazon and much more .
this virtual machines are very benifical for us 



>### cost saving 
  In pc or laptops much of the software are not run by the system requirement by using this machines work requirement are complete by at low cost and we can stop or start at any time

>### security
  In our pc we can just use an Antivirus for security but it not suffcient 
  Virtual machines companies are provides more than antivirus security
 
>### Flexibility
  In that we can anytime stop or start any virtual machines without data loss
  We can easily launch any machines at any time anywhere.
 
>### Mobility
  The virtual machine it can be easily use by any device from any place at any time
  virtual machine is handle by easily 
 
>### Insight
 the virtual machine is can be easy to handle 
 by the virtual machine data transfer speed is fast the machine can use any an social media as same
 
>### Quality Control
 In that the first thing is included the service 
 the service is best then the user are increases
 in virtual machine quality control is main purpose 
 
>### Disaster Recovery
 In the our life day by day many disasters are comes
 in that our running laptop are shunt down at any time due to our cutoff.
 by using virtual machine our all work done on cloud platform
 by that service using no data lost occured or any time we can use the last work .
 
>### Automatic Software update
  In virtual machine we need to update or use latest version of the software or any device 
  in hand our mobile also we need latest version of operating system
  in virtual machine we need up todate for using virtual machine
  by using cloud server we need the lastest software by using virtual machine we get latest technology of software lauched by  software company
 
-----------
 
>### Disaster Recovery

  In our real machine we face many problems in day to day life
  that many problems we face
  Light cutoff
  software problem
  Pc crash
  Hardware problem
  we face all of that in our pc 
  In virtual machine we get safty of our data by using the machine 
   that machine we get safty of our data 
   by virtual machine we get the surty of data 
     also we get the safty of data

 ## What is Virtual machine
 
 In virtual machine we need just any pc or laptop of not much high performance 
  just we need a simple computers 
  in the virtual machine we get an a projector like screen 
  just we can use this screen on our pc
  in that we need an a cloud account 
  goto cloud account we need to only login and we get much type of varity of modes or specific types of super computer details
  just we select any of them and buy we get and ip address
  just add this ip in our pc we get a virtual screen for use
  Its very simple to use .
  Cloud server are provided by many companies like amazon microsoft
    Virtual machine is the emulator of the any platform 
   virtual machine is the one type of platforms just we can add any type operating system on that
 -----------
  
 ### Types of cloud computing

 1)IaaS
 2)PaaS
 3)SaaS
 
 >### IaaS :-
 
Infrastructure as a Service
 It is basic services in cloud computing
 ifra as a service is use by Microsoft Azure AWS(Amazon Web services)
  
 >### PaaS
 
Platform as a Service
 it is the application platform
 By using that application get platform for the serice can use by user
 Platform as a service is used by Google apps aws azur
 
 >### SaaS
 
 Software as a Service:- 
 it the platform for hosting the application or software
 this type is provide the platform or hosting for the app
 Software as a service is by netflix prime and Spotify
 
 >### Benifits
 
    developer can focus on development infrastructure of cloud
    Developer can develop the program without any restriction
    It developes without any efforts
    SaaS has been efficiently managing application development phases in the cloud that includes testing
    It is work without any conditions it just need internet connection

>### the Cloud deployment models 
 
1) Public Cloud
 2) Private Cloud
 3) Hybrid Cloud
 4) Community Cloud
 
 - Public Cloud. 
  In the Public Cloud server we get low cost
  In that the server we get the space in complex of different server data 
  In that Public server can easily handle for the hosting
  
 - Private Cloud
  In the private cloud server is highly costly
  In that we get lot of space in that 
  we can built a privte own server 
  but it can need highly service or it is expensive 
  In that Private server we get a much more security than public server
  Private server is used by banks or any type of online transaction websites
  
  
 - Hybrid Cloud
   
   In hybrid Cloud server it is not much high and low very low cost 
   in hybrid server we get more security
   in that we also work for security
   it is mainly used by small website or any e commerce website
   
   
  - Community Cloud
   
   In the Community Cloud Server its cost is low
   In that many companies can work at one place or one site
   In that many companies work on same plan at one place
   It get more privacy in that
   Community cloud server is a third-party server

--------------

 ###  an Availability Zone
 
    The availability Zone is the concept of that includes the region and low latency 
    for the data transfer in that the data of different zones are merge with. each other without any problems
    In two different regions the we get the seprate data seprate server 
    sprate power that's why the many of space need in that all type of concept are includes.

-------------
   
  ### Regions 

  Regions are localized area
  regions are made by different of domains
  In region we get a seprate data server at one place 
  all of the data will store in that place
  Every some Countries we get an different server for data transfer
  that why the we need different server in different region 
  it needs high bandwidth Speed it need cool area for the server

----------

### Serverless Computing

 Serverless computing is invented by  Austen Collins

serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider runs the server
Serverless computing get the runs the application and our peogram without any specific server
it hosted by one big server
In that many types of application can run on one server with using different functions
In that server we get many applications can work on that one server

------------

### benefits of using Storage in the cloud
    
    In the cloud storage we can get a virtual storage
    it is very low to cost 
    Data tiring is cost saving
    Backup may be slower but we get full free data 
    We not get any problems about data or storage
    Restore may be slower
    Much more internet's data we need
    More internet consumes
    Many companies provide a free storage at some size 
    It can not much but it helpful 
    In that we get a some space on cloud

----------- 

 ### Type of Storage
    
   1) personal Cloud Storage
   2) Public Cloud Storage
   3) Hybrid Cloud Storage
   4) Private Cloud Storage
    
  - Personal Cloud Storage
  
    In personal Cloud storage it can used by only onwer on of their storage
    in that no one can use this storage
    
   - Public Cloud storage
   
     In that Storage it can be use by anyone 
     It is used by everyone those who can vist the storage
     anyone can download the data from anywhere
     
   - Hybrid Cloud Storage 
   
      It can be used by the server or the client of the data 
      In that Storage not only Client and server can edit or change the data
      
   - Private Cloud storage
   
     Private Cloud storage is can be used by only owner of storage 
     Private storage is not view by anyone
     it only use by Client only

-------------

### Fault Domain


    It is hardware components that share the point of failure
    fault domain is include hardware and software including
    In the hardware the power machine failure and network
    fault is recovered or reboot by 30 minutes
    
------------    

### Vnet :

    Vnet is virtual network
    In virtual network is a representation of our own networks in Cloud
    By using virtual network we get more secure of our data with server
    vNet is provided by Microsoft Azaur
    By using Vnet we get end to end data transfer with security
    Vnet is likely similar to Firewall
    Vnet gets a security of our data and our surfing in internet
    in virtual machine we get Vnet as a firewalls

### scaling in cloud computing
     
 Scaling is defined as the ability for an IT resource to handle growing or decreasing demands in a capable manner 
 it is one of the benefical features in cloud computing
 In the scale the buisness is up down growth and all the components are shows in scale
 it reduces the IT cost 
 It reduces the cost of IT Companies of manintance
 in the cloud computing maintaince is very easy 
 There is vertical and horizontal scale in cloud computing
 Vertical scale is facts of the biggest size of servers
