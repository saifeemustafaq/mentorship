# Disaster Recovery :

![](https://cdn.meritalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Disaster-recovery-min.jpg)

- Cloud disaster recovery typically provides similar services as an on-premises or company-maintained off-premises disaster recovery plan (DRP) facility, but in an economical, efficient and provider-managed platform.

- A cloud DRP vendor provisions users and storage space and continuously update designated systems with client software installed on each system.

- Users have the ability to add, edit and delete systems and storage capacity, without having to consider the back-end supported infrastructure.

- A cloud-based disaster recovery solution enables the user to scale up the entire cloud DRP solution from some-to-many. The user is normally billed on a monthly basis only for the storage and client software licenses. 

- Most Cloud DR also provisions backup and recovery for critical server machines that host enterprise-level applications like MS-SQL, Oracle, etc

### How does disaster recovery in cloud computing differ from traditional disaster recovery ?

##### Ans.

- Traditional disaster recovery involves building a remote disaster recovery (DR) site, which requires constant maintenance and support on your part. In this case, data protection and disaster recovery are performed manually, which can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. 

- Disaster recovery in cloud computing entails storing critical data and applications in cloud storage and failing over to a secondary site in case of a disaster. Cloud computing services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis and can be accessed from anywhere and at any time. Backup and disaster recovery in cloud computing can be automated, requiring minimum input on your part.

### How does disaster recovery planning work in cloud computing?

##### Ans.

- Creating, testing, and updating a DR plan can prepare your organization for an unexpected disaster and ensure safety and continuity for your business. A comprehensive DR plan should take into account your infrastructure, potential threats and vulnerabilities, most critical assets and the order of their recovery, and workable DR strategies.

- Integration of cloud computing services in disaster recovery allows you to design a DR plan and automate each step of the recovery process.

## Cloud disaster recovery vs. traditional disaster recovery

The essential element of traditional disaster recovery is a secondary data center, which can store all redundant copies of critical data, and to which you can fail over production workloads. A traditional on-premises DR site generally includes the following:

- A dedicated facility for housing the IT infrastructure, including maintenance employees and computing equipment.

- Sufficient server capacity to ensure a high level of operational performance and allow the data center to scale up or scale out depending on your business needs.

- Internet connectivity with sufficient bandwidth to enable remote access to the secondary data center.

- Network infrastructure, including firewalls, routers, and switches, to ensure a reliable connection between the primaryand secondary data centers, as well as provide data availability.

###### However, traditional disaster recovery can often be too complex to manage and monitor.

Disaster recovery in cloud computing can effectively deal with most issues of traditional disaster recovery. The benefits include the following:

- You don’t need to build a secondary physical site, and buy additional hardware and software to support critical operations. With disaster recovery in cloud computing, you get access to cloud storage, which can be used as a secondary DR site.

- Depending on your current business demands, you can easily scale up or down by adding required cloud computing resources.

- With its affordable pay-as-you go pricing model, you are required to pay only for the cloud computing services you actually use.

- Disaster recovery in cloud computing can be performed in a matter of minutes from anywhere. The only thing you need is a device that is connected to the internet.

## Benefits of cloud DR :-

1. High-reliability and geo-redundancy :-)  
          One essential hallmark of a cloud provider is a global footprint, ensuring multiple data centers to support users across major global geopolitical regions. Cloud providers use this to improve service reliability and ensure redundancy.

2. Easy testing and fast recovery :-)  
          Cloud workloads routinely operate with VMs, making it easy to copy VM image files to in-house test servers to validate workload availability without affecting production workloads

# What is Capital expenditure (CapEx) ?

![](https://www.softwareadvisoryservice.com/media/2417/what-is-capex.png)

##### Ans. 

- A capital expenditure is incurred when a business spends money, uses collateral, or takes on debt to either buy a new asset or add to the value of an existing asset with the expectation of receiving benefits for longer than a single tax year. Essentially, a capital expenditure represents an investment in the business.

- Capital expenses are recorded as assets on a company's balance sheet rather than as expenses on the income statement. The asset is then depreciated over the total life of the asset, with a period depreciation expense charged to the company's income statement, normally monthly.

- Accumulated depreciation is recorded on the company's balance sheet as the summation of all depreciation expenses, and it reduces the value of the asset over the life of that asset.

- Examples of capital expenses include the purchase of fixed assets, such as new buildings or business equipment, upgrades to existing facilities, and the acquisition of intangible assets, such as patents.

- Capex or expenses are depreciated or amortized over a span of years. For example, it can buy equipment/ buildings or add value to an existing asset to upgrade beyond the current financial year.

- Most often capital expenses are mostly depreciated over a five to ten years period, but sometimes may be depreciated over twenty years in the case of real estate properties.

# What is Operational expenditure (OpeEx)?

![](https://www.softwareadvisoryservice.com/media/2418/what-is-opex.png)

##### Ans.

- Operating expenses are expenses incurred during regular business, such as general and administrative expenses, research and development, and the cost of goods sold.

- Operating expenses are much easier to understand conceptually than capital expenses since they are part of the day-to-day operations. All operating expenses are recorded on a company's income statement as expenses in the period when they were incurred.

- Operating expenses include a wide range of expense types, from office supplies and travel and distribution expenses to licensing fees, utilities, property insurance, and property taxes.

-  If equipment is leased instead of purchased, it is typically considered an operating expense. General repairs and maintenance of existing fixed assets such as buildings and equipment are also considered operating expenses unless the improvements will increase the useful life of the asset.

- This can be a financially attractive option for the company if the company has limited cash flow.

- Operating expenses are completely tax-deductible. Therefore it is more attractive for a company to lease an item and assign its cost to operating expenses rather than purchase it.

# Capex, Opex and the Cloud

- There are three popular types of Cloud computing: private, public, and hybrid. Understanding Capex and Opex is instrumental in recognising the differences between the different types of Clouds.

- With the public Cloud, the service provider is the one making the Capex, so that their users can buy in an Opex or pay as you go model.

- A private Cloud involves an organisation’s IT team doing the Capex, so that users or business units within a company will be able to consume the resources in an Opex or pay as you go model.

- Businesses can use resources from both private and public Clouds, which becomes a hybrid Cloud. A hybrid Cloud can be managed by a single solution. If the buyer of the public Cloud is your IT team, then the hybrid Cloud essentially becomes a combination of Capex and Opex models. This gives businesses better flexibility to control their costs.

- Cloud Services are fast becoming the norm for any modern business. However, there are so many solutions available that spending time finding the right system for you can cost your business a significant amount of time and money, and runs the risk of you implementing a solution that isn’t ideal.

# What are the Cloud deployment models ?

##### Ans.

A cloud deployment model is a specific configuration of environment parameters such as the accessibility and proprietorship of the deployment infrastructure and storage size. It means that deployment types vary depending on who controls the infrastructure and where it resides.

# 1.) Public Cloud :

- The name speaks for itself: public clouds are available to the general public, and data are created and stored on third-party servers.

- Server infrastructure belongs to service providers that manage them and administer pool resources, which is why there is no need for user companies to buy and maintain their hardware. Provider companies offer resources as a service both free of charge or on a pay-per-use basis via the Internet connection. Users can scale resources when required.

- The public cloud deployment model is the first choice for businesses that operate within the industries with low privacy concerns. When it comes to popular public cloud deployment models, examples are Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) — the top service provider, Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine, IBM Cloud, Salesforce Heroku and others.

![](https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/a-cloud-provider@2x.png)

### Advantages:

#### Hassle-free infrastructure management.
     Having a third party running your cloud infrastructure is convenient: you do not need to develop and maintain your software as the service provider does it for you.

#### High scalability.
     You can easily extend the available capacity as your company requirements increase.

#### Reduced costs.
     You pay only for the service you use, no need to invest in hardware or software.

#### 24/7 uptime.
     An extensive network of the provider’s servers ensures the constant availability of your infrastructure and its improved operation time.

### Disadvantages

#### Compromised reliability.
     That same server network is also meant to ensure against failures.

#### Data security and privacy give rise to concern.
     Although access to data is easy, a public deployment model deprives users of knowing where their information is kept and who has access to it.

#### The lack of a bespoke service.
     Service providers have only standardized service options, which is why they will probably fail to satisfy their requirements if they are unusual.

# 2.) Private Cloud :
 
- There is little to no difference between a public and a private model from the technical point of view, as their architectures are very similar. However, opposed to a public cloud that is available to the general public, only one specific company owns a private one. That is why it is also called an internal or corporate.

- Only one organization uses this deployment model to run its workloads, and the server can be hosted externally or on the premises of the user company. Regardless of their physical location, these infrastructures are maintained on a designated private network and use software and hardware that are intended for a specific company.

- If compared to a public cloud, a private one provides wider opportunities for customizing the infrastructure to the company’s requirements. A private model is especially suitable for companies that seek to safeguard their mission-critical operations or for businesses with changing requirements.

- Multiple public cloud service providers — including Amazon, IBM, Cisco, Dell and Red Hat — also provide private solutions along with public ones.

### Benefits :

- Bespoke and flexible development and high scalability, which allows companies to customize their infrastructures in accordance with their requirements

- High security, privacy and reliability as only authorized persons can access resources

### Drawbacks :

- The major disadvantage of the private cloud deployment model is its cost, as it requires considerable expenses on hardware, software and staff training. That is why this secure and flexible computing deployment model is not a choice for small companies.

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

# 3.) Community Cloud :

- A community deployment model largely resembles a private one; the only difference is the set of users. While a private type implies that only one company owns the server, in the case of a community one, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources.

- If the organizations have uniform security, privacy and performance requirements, this multi-tenant data center architecture helps companies achieve their business-specific objectives. That is why a community model is particularly suited for organizations that work on joint projects. In that case, a centralized cloud facilitates project development, management and implementation. Also, the costs are shared across all users.

![](https://www.sam-solutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/community-cloud@2x.png)

### Strengths :

- Cost reduction

- Improved security, privacy and reliability

- Ease of data sharing and collaboration

### Shortcomings :

- High cost if compared to a public deployment model

- Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity

- It is not widespread so far

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

# 4. Hybrid Cloud :

- As it is usually the case with any hybrid phenomenon, a hybrid cloud encompasses the best features of the above-mentioned deployment models — public, private and community ones. It allows companies to mix and match the facets of all three types that best suit their requirements.

- As an example, a company can balance its load by locating mission-critical workloads on a secure private cloud and deploying less sensitive ones to a public one. Hybrid cloud deployment model not only safeguards and controls strategically important assets but does so in the most cost- and resource-effective way possible for each specific case. Also, this approach facilitates data and application portability.

### Benefits :

- Improved security and privacy

- Enhanced scalability and flexibility

- Reasonable price

# What are the Types of cloud services ?

![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQX7uN9ugANmKrS9WuOwD87LXb5UNGK9D9kbEkqq8psPCh0TaEc&usqp=CAU)

##### Ans.

Cloud computing has evolved over the time it has been majorly divided into three broad service categories: Infrastructure as a Service(IAAS), Platform as a Service (PAAS) and Software as a Service (SAAS) which are broadly discussed below:

![](https://www.uniprint.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cloud-service-models-diagram.png)

### 1. Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS) :

- Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In an IAAS model, a third party provider hosts hardware, software, servers, storage and other infrastructure components on the behalf of its users.

- IAAS providers also host users’ applications and handle tasks including system maintenance backup and resiliency planning.

- IAAS platforms offer highly scalable resources that can be adjusted on-demand which makes it a well-suited for workloads that are temporary, experimental or change unexpectedly.

- Other characteristics of IAAS environments include the automation of administrative tasks, dynamic scaling, desktop virtualization and policy-based services.

- Technically, the IaaS market has a relatively low barrier of entry, but it may require substantial financial investment in order to build and support the cloud infrastructure.

- Mature open-source cloud management frameworks like OpenStack are available to everyone and provide strong a software foundation for companies that want to build their private cloud or become a public cloud provider.

- Examples of IaaS: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metacloud, Google Compute Engine (GCE)

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

### 2.) Software as a service (SaaS) :

- Software as a Service(SAAS) is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network, typically the Internet.

- SAAS has become an increasingly prevalent delivery model as underlying technologies that support Web services and service-oriented architecture (SOA) mature and new development approaches, such as Ajax, become popular.

- SAAS is closely related to the ASP (Application service provider) and on-demand computing software delivery models.

- IDC identifies two slightly different delivery models for SAAS namely the hosted application model and the software development model.

- Most common examples of SaaS are Microsoft Office 360, AppDynamics, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google G Suite, Zoho, Salesforce, Marketo, Oracle CRM, Pardot Marketing Automation, and SAP Business ByDesign.

- Examples of SaaS: Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Google Apps.

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

### 3.) Platform as a Service (PaaS) :

- Platform as a Service (PAAS) is a cloud computing model that delivers applications over the internet. In a PAAS model, a cloud provider delivers hardware and software tolls, usually those needed for application development, to its users as a service.

- A PAAS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PAAS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.

- PAAS doesn’t replace a business' entire infrastructure but instead, a business relies on PAAS providers for key services, such as Java development or application hosting.

- A PAAS provider, however, supports all the underlying computing and software; users only need to log in and start using the platform-usually through a Web browser interface.

- PAAS providers then charge for that access on a per-user basis or on a monthly basis.

- Some key players offering PaaS are Bluemix, CloudBees, Salesforce.com, Google App Engine, Heroku, AWS, Microsoft Azure, OpenShift, Oracle Cloud, SAP and OpenShift.
