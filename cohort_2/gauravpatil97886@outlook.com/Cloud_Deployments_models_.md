## DEPLOYMENT MODELS VS SERVICE MODELS:
-----

#### There are four main cloud deployment models:

------
##### public Cloud
##### Private Cloud
##### Community Cloud
##### Hybrid Cloud


-------
- These refer to the size, placement, and access level of a cloud environment. 
- They aren’t the same as the service models – Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
- If you aren’t 100% about each of these, you can take a look at this article for a description of each one.
-----
### PUBLIC CLOUD:

-- The public cloud deployment model is the most widely understood out of the four. Chances are you use some sort of public cloud product already.
****Some of the most common examples of public cloud offerings are****:

****SaaS**** – Gmail, Microsoft 365, Dropbox, etc…
****PaaS**** – Google App Engine, Heroku…
****IaaS**** – Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services…


------
#### Public Cloud – Definition

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines public cloud as:

-  “The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public.
It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them
. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.”

****Basically, public clouds

- Are open to the public
- Can be owned, managed, and operated by pretty much anyone
- Are located on the provider‘s premises
- To be open to everyone, public cloud deployment services are usually delivered over the internet.
- All you need is a web browser to access all sorts of software and tools. Anyone with the right hardware and resources can operate a public cloud.
- Just set up your servers and start renting out storage and computing power.


--------
### Public Cloud – Pros

****The main advantages of using a public cloud are****:

- Low price (sometimes even free)
- Scalable
- Location independence
- It‘s easy!
- The big cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft have huge pools of computing resources powering their public cloud services
. This has to massive benefits for you. Firstly, it means you can take advantage of economy of scale. The cost of a large network is split between many people, 
so capital overheads and operational costs drop for individual users. Many cloud providers even let you have a certain amount of cloud access for free (e.g. Google drive).

****Secondly, it means you have access to essentially unlimited computing resources instantaneously. Traditionally
, if your website suddenly had a 20x spike in traffic, your servers would be overloaded and it would crash. Using something like Amazon Web Services, 
your website could scale from getting a few visitors per hour to millions and never go down. And, you would only pay for what you actually use.

****The other key advantage of public cloud is its location independence and ease of use. You don‘t need to worry about where you are,


the location of hardware, setup, network settings, infrastructure, or anything like that. Just plug in and pay for what you use as you use it. Businesses of all sizes are using the public cloud for web applications, document collaboration,
webmail, and storage of non-sensitive data
------


### Public Cloud – Cons

Sounds great so far, but there are some downsides that many companies can‘t ignore. 
##### The main ones are:

##### Security concerns
##### The law and location of your data
##### Lack of control

- Security concerns are a major roadblock for many companies.
Especially ones that deal with sensitive data. When using a public cloud, 
your application and data could be sharing servers and hardware with anyone.
That‘s a risk for some types of data, and straight up against the law for others. Also, with public cloud, your data could be stored in another country where laws concerning data storage are different.


-----

### Public Cloud – Who‘s it For?

Public cloud has some serious advantages, and that‘s why it‘s the most commonly used of the deployment models. 
Check out this article for even more detail. It‘s ideal for small and medium businesses, especially ones with fluctuating or growing demands.

##### The biggest public cloud service providers are

- ****Amazon Web Services
- ****Microsoft Azure
- ****IBM Cloud
- ****Google Cloud Platform
The ****2017 RightScale State**** of the Cloud Survey found that public cloud is growing in popularity this year. 
This is because public cloud providers are gaining more trust from big companies with their sensitive IT assets.

- However, the lack of control over factors such as privacy,
security, and location of infrastructure means that businesses 
with sensitive data or specific performance needs will need another solution.

# community Cloud – Pros:

****community cloud has many of the advantages of both public and private clouds. Those are

### >Cloud configuration and security that meet the needs of your industry
### >More scalable than private cloud
### >Cheaper than private cloud


- If public cloud isn‘t going work, and private cloud is too difficult, take a look for a community cloud in your industry. Or, find some buddies and set up your own! The best-case scenario is that you get cheaper access to a cloud that is configured in a way that suits your needs. Of course, a community cloud needs to exist for this to happen.

- A community cloud can be configured to comply with specific data laws or performance requirements. And, because setup and running costs are shared between multiple organizations, the economy of scale savings come back. Also, if the community is quite large, flexibility and scalability will be increased for each individual organization too.


------


# community Cloud – Cons:

The main drawbacks of using community cloud are:

#### >A community cloud doesn‘t exist for every community
#### >Compromise – won‘t get the full benefits of either public or private

Firstly, there isn‘t going to be a community cloud to solve every problem. Community cloud is the newest deployment models of cloud computing.

Also, the community cloud deployment model is a compromise solution. That means you won‘t get the full benefits of either public or private cloud. Community cloud will usually be more expensive than a more generic public cloud, but won‘t allow for all the customization of a private cloud.

------

## community Cloud – Who‘s it For?

If your business has very similar cloud computing needs to many others, community cloud might be a good fit. This will be highly dependent on what‘s available in your industry.

One example is NYSE Capital Market Community Platform. It‘s a kind of financial sector community cloud. Another example is AWS GovCloud. Amazon has set up a community cloud to be used by all the different parts of the US government that meet the legal and security standards they require.

-----

# HYBRID CLOUD

The last deployment model we‘re going to look at is hybrid cloud. As you may have guessed from the name, it is a combination of any of the cloud computing deployment models we‘ve already looked at. One common use of hybrid cloud is a mix of public and private – with sensitive data staying in a ’private‘ section, and other less critical tasks done in a public cloud.

Many companies are planning on using multiple clouds to use for different purposes. The 2017 RightScale State of the Cloud Survey found that 85% of respondents have a strategy to use multiple clouds. More than half said this would be in the form of hybrid cloud.

## Hybrid Cloud – Definition

NIST definition:
------


The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds)

Basically, any cloud configuration that combines multiple deployment models is a hybrid cloud. As long as they are ’bound together‘ somehow to form a coherent unit.

------

## Hybrid Cloud – Pros

Just like community cloud, the hybrid cloud deployment model aims to get benefits from multiple deployment models. By having both a private (or community) cloud that works seamlessly with a public cloud means you can


#### >Keep sensitive data safe
#### >Still, get some of the scalability and cost-effectiveness of public cloud
#### >Ultimate flexibility



Flexibility is the main drawcard of hybrid cloud. By combining different deployment models, you can pick and choose the perfect balance between legal compliance, security, and scalability.

## Hybrid Cloud – Cons
The main challenges of hybrid cloud are


#### >Complexity
#### >Difficulty communicating between cloud models
#### >More expensive than public or community models



Combining multiple deployment models means things get complicated quickly. Making sure sensitive data is completely separated from the more public parts of a hybrid cloud can be tricky. Luckily, many cloud providers are encouraging businesses to use this model and will be happy to help you get set up.

------

## Hybrid Cloud – Who‘s It For?

Anyone that wants to pick and choose different elements from different cloud models can make use of hybrid cloud. A common example is storing and analyzing sensitive data on a private cloud, but using a public cloud for a website and public-facing applications. Another is to use a private cloud for base-level processing, but have public cloud available for sudden spikes in demand that the private cloud can‘t deal with. This is called cloud bursting, and many businesses are already using this idea to increase uptime.

If neither public or private cloud meets all of your needs, perhaps a hybrid of the two will do the job.

Some of the biggest providers include Microsoft, VMware, Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Cisco, and Dell.

-------


## HOW TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM

All of these models are being used extensively by companies all around the world. Each is designed to solve a specific set of problems. To find the best model for you or your company starts with defining your requirements for:

#### >Scalability – Is your user activity growing quickly or unpredictable with spikes in demand?
#### >Privacy and security – Do you have any sensitive data that doesn‘t belong on a public server?
#### >Ease of use – How much time and money do you have to invest in learning and training?
#### >Pricing model – What‘s your monthly subscription budget? How much capital can you spend upfront?
#### >Flexibility – How flexible/rigid are your computing, processing, and storage needs?

### ≥Legal compliance – Are there any relevant laws in your country or industry?


Answer all of these and you‘ll have an idea of whether to go with the public, private, community, or hybrid cloud (or none at all!).

# HOW TO GET STARTED WITH THE CLOUD

Once you‘ve figured out the deployment model you want to use, the next step is to choose a service provider and get set up. Picking one is a whole different topic [we go into in more detail here](https://www.devteam.space/blog/top-10-cloud-computing-services-providers/#INFRASTRUCTURE_AS_A_SERVICE) . At the moment, it looks like Amazon and Microsoft are going to dominate the consumer cloud market for a while. If you‘re unsure, there are companies out there that will be happy to help you get started with cloud computing. They can help you choose the right cloud model and configuration, migrate your current systems over to the cloud, and even start building your own cloud-native applications.

Cloud computing can help you keep up with leaders in your industry and gain a serious advantage over others. New tools and [ideas like DevOps](https://www.devteam.space/blog/devops-implementation-best-practices/) 
are helping businesse deliver services over the internet faster and more reliably than ever before. Right now is the perfect time to get started with the cloud.

# What is diffrent abot cloud security............


Cloud security is the protection of data, applications, and infrastructures involved in cloud computing. Many aspects of security for cloud environments (whether it’s a public, private, or hybrid cloud) are the same as for any on-premise IT architecture.

High-level security concerns—like unauthorized data exposure and leaks, weak access controls, susceptibility to attacks, and availability disruptions—affect traditional IT and cloud systems alike. Like any computing environment, cloud security involves maintaining adequate preventative protections so you:

Know that the data and systems are safe.
Can see the current state of security.
Know immediately if anything unusual happens.
Can trace and respond to unexpected events.


---------------
## Why cloud security is different

While many people understand the benefits of cloud computing, they’re equally deterred by the security threats. We get it. It’s hard to wrap your head around something that exists somewhere between amorphous resources sent through the internet and a physical server. It’s a dynamic environment where things are always changing—like security threats. The thing is that, for the most part, cloud security is IT security. And once you understand the specific differences, the word “cloud” doesn’t feel as insecure.

--------

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a business service model that delivers computer infrastructure technology on an outsourced, rental basis to support “virtual data center” operations. Typically, IaaS provides hardware, storage, servers and data center space or network components; it may also include software.

An IaaS provider provides policy-based services and is responsible for housing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure equipment it provides for a client. Clients usually pay on a per-use or utility computing basis.

### Characteristics of IaaS systems include:

Automated administrative tasks
Dynamic scaling
Platform virtualization technology
GUI and API-based access
Internet connectivity
IaaS is also described as one of three main categories of cloud computing service. The other two are software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
