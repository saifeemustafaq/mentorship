-  Today, cloud computing applications and platforms are rapidly growing across all industries, serving as the IT infrastructure that drives new digital businesses. These platforms and applications have revolutionized the ways in which businesses function, and have made processes easier. In fact, more than 77 percent of businesses today have at least some portion of their computing infrastructure in the cloud.

- While there are many cloud computing platforms available, two platforms dominate the cloud computing industry. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure are the two giants in the world of cloud computing.

- While ****AWS is the largest cloud computing platform**** Microsoft Azure is the fastest-growing and second-largest. This article focuses on Microsoft Azure and what is Azure—its services and uses. But before we delve into Microsoft Azure, here’s a look at everything you’ll find in this article:

### What is cloud computing?
### Why is cloud computing important?
### What is Azure?
### What are the various Azure services?
### What are the various uses of Azure?

****Before diving into what is Azure, you should first know what cloud computing is.

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a technology that provides access to various computing resources over the internet. All you need to do is use your computer or mobile device to connect to your cloud service provider through the internet. Once connected, you get access to computing resources, which may include serverless computing, virtual machines, storage, and various other things.

Basically, cloud service providers have massive data centers that contain hundreds of servers, storage systems and components that are crucial for many kinds of organizations. These data centers are in secure locations and store a large amount of data. The users connect to these data centers to collect data or use it when required. Users can take advantage of various services; for example, if you want a notification every time someone sends you a text or an email, cloud services can help you. The best part about cloud platforms is that you pay only for the services you use, and there are no charges upfront.

Cloud computing can be used for various purposes: machine learning, data analysis, storage and backup, streaming media content and so much more. Here’s an interesting fact about the cloud: all the shows and movies that you see on Netflix are actually stored in the cloud. Also, the cloud can be beneficial for creating and testing applications, automating software delivery, and hosting blogs.

## Why is Cloud Computing Important?

Let’s assume that you have an idea for a revolutionary application that can provide great user experience and can become highly profitable. For the application to become successful, you will need to release it on the internet for people to find it, use it, and spread the word about its advantages. However, releasing an application on the internet is not as easy as it seems.

To do so, you will need various components, like servers, storage devices, developers, dedicated networks, and application security to ensure that your solution works the way it is intended to. These are a lot of components, which can be problematic.

Buying each of these components individually is very expensive and risky. You would need a huge amount of capital to ensure that your application works properly. And if the application doesn’t become popular, you would lose your investment. On the flip side, if the application becomes immensely popular, you will have to buy more servers and storage to cater to more users, which can again increase your costs. This is where cloud computing can come to the rescue. It has many benefits, including offering safe storage and scalability all at once.

## What is Microsoft Azure?

Azure is a cloud computing platform and an online portal that allows you to access and manage cloud services and resources provided by Microsoft. These services and resources include storing your data and transforming it, depending on your requirements. To get access to these resources and services, all you need to have is an active internet connection and the ability to connect to the Azure portal.

Things that you should know about Azure:

It was launched on February 1, 2010, significantly later than its main competitor, AWS.
It’s free to start and follows a pay-per-use model, which means you pay only for the services you opt for.
Interestingly, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies use Azure services for their cloud computing needs.
Azure supports multiple programming languages, including Java, Node Js, and C#.
Let’s now discuss what are the various Microsoft Azure services in the what is Azure article.

What are the Various Azure Services and How does Azure Work?
Azure provides more than 200 services, are divided into 18 categories. These categories include computing, networking, storage, IoT, migration, mobile, analytics, containers, artificial intelligence, and other machine learning, integration, management tools, developer tools, security, databases, DevOps, media identity, and web services. Let’s take a look at some of the major Azure services by category:

|-----------|
|compute Services|
|----------------|

|Virtual Machine|
|--------|
|This service enables you to create a virtual machine in Windows, Linux or any other configuration in seconds.|
|---------------------|
|Cloud Service|
|---------|

- This service lets you create scalable applications within the cloud. Once the application is deployed, everything, including provisioning, load balancing, and health monitoring, is taken care of by Azure. 

----------

### Service Fabric

- With service fabric, the process of developing a microservice is immensely simplified. Microservice is an application that contains other bundled smaller applications.

--------

#### Functions

- With functions, you can create applications in any programming language. The best part about this service is that you need not worry about hardware requirements while developing applications because Azure takes care of that. All you need to do is provide the code.

-----++

#### Networking

#### Azure CDN
- Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network) is for delivering content to users. It uses a high bandwidth, and content can be transferred to any person around the globe. The CDN service uses a network of servers placed strategically around the globe so that the users can access the data as soon as possible.

--------

#### Express Route 
This service lets you connect your on-premise network to the Microsoft cloud or any other services that you want, through a private connection. So, the only communications that will happen here will be between the enterprise network and the service that you want. 

--------

#### Virtual network
The virtual network allows you to have any of the Azure services communicate with one another privately and securely. 

--------

#### Azure DNS
This service allows you to host your DNS domains or system domains on Azure.

------

#### Storage
##### Disk Storage 
- This service allows you to choose from either HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or SSD (Solid State Drive) as your storage option along with your virtual machine.
- Blob Storage 
- This service is optimized to store a massive amount of unstructured data, including text and even binary data. 

------++++

#### File Storage
- This is a managed file storage service that can be accessed via industry SMB (server message block) protocol. 
Queue Storage 
- With queue storage, you can provide stable message queuing for a large workload. This service can be accessed from anywhere in this world.
- Next in this what is Azure article, let’s look at what are the uses of Azure.

## ListList of the Advantages of Microsoft Azure

### .1 Microsoft Azure offers high availability.
When you go through the legal agreement which covers the services provided by Azure, you’ll find that the uptime guarantee you’re given is 99.95%. In real-time hours, that means you can expect about 4.5 hours of downtime over the course of an entire year. Similar services from competitive brands offer uptime percentages that are 98%, 95%, and sometimes as low as 90% for the same price that you’ll get with Azure.


--------

## 2. It offers you a strong security profile.
Azure follows the DADSC approach to security: detect, assess, diagnose, stabilize, and close. When this profile is paired with the cyber-security controls that are built into the platform, you’ll be able to take their multiple compliance certifications and turn them into your next best assets. End users are covered with Azure, as is the platform, which reduces the risk of data loss. At the same time, multi-factor authentication and application passwords offer another layer of security to stop information theft.

------

## 3. Azure offers good scalability options.
Like most businesses, you probably have a day or two when you maximize your data use, then the rest of the month, you use a minimal amount. With Azure, you’re not forced to purchase data packets or other upgrades to gain access to the computer power you need for that day or two each month. Just click on the upgrades that you need, then remove them when you’ve gotten the work done. This structure makes it easier to pay only for what you use.

-------

## 4. It is a cost-effective solution for an IT budget.
Because you’re using a cloud provider, you don’t have the same capital investments into IT infrastructure that other businesses face. For the SMB, that means being able to become instantly competitive on a global stage with their technology. You only purchase what you need, when you need it. In return, the cloud environment with Azure gives you the ability to launch customer apps or internal apps. You lose the burden of hardware costs and maintenance without losing the benefits of having them because of your access to the cloud.

-------

## 5. There are multiple redundancies in place to maintain data access.
Microsoft Azure has access to a wide range of global data centers that will help you be able to access your data. That is how they can assure continuous availability at higher levels than their competition. Even if one of the data centers needs to be taken down for maintenance, you’re still good to go because you can just access another data center when you need to put data in or take it out for your business.

--------

## 6. Azure allows you to use any framework, language, or tool.
When you have Microsoft Azure working for you, then you can turn your ideas into solutions very quickly. All you need to do is bring your code to start doing what you already love. Azure allows you to build apps with the language you prefer, including .NET, Java, and Node.js, then gives you access to tools like Visual Studio. This allows you to stay productive while focusing on the coding instead of how it is managed.


------

## 7. You are given access to app connectors within the Microsoft family of products.
With Microsoft Azure, you’re able to connect devices, data, and applications with 150+ connectors that come out-of-the-box with your investment. Office 365 is one of the best connectors, allowing you to integrate coding and administration duties into one platform. Azure also works with Dropbox, Google services, Twitter, Salesforce, and many others.


--------
## 8. You can automate many of your repetitive tasks.
Azure allows you to manage large, complex applications with the tools you prefer to use. That includes BASH, Power Shell, or REST APIs. That means you can quickly automate your time-consuming repetitive tasks to speed up your app delivery without compromising the quality of your work. Built-in supports for analytics, patching, monitoring, backups, and site recovery for your apps are included, which means you get to focus on your work instead of trying to maintain your infrastructure.
