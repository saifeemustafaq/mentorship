DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

#### >How DevOps Works?

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.

Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.

Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.

Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.

Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model, which emphasizes values such as ownership and accountability. Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run).

-----
****DevOps-What-is_security****
#### 6.Security

![](https://d1.awsstatic.com/Developer%20Marketing/DevOps/DevOps-What-is_security.4246af1c9c37ce52cca4fac51f786a524836e04d.png)

Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing security by using automated compliance policies, fine-grained controls, and configuration management techniques. For example, using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and then track compliance at scale.

#### Why DevOps Matters?

Software and the Internet have transformed the world and its industries, from shopping to entertainment to banking. Software no longer merely supports a business; rather it becomes an integral component of every part of a business. Companies interact with their customers through software delivered as online services or applications and on all sorts of devices. They also use software to increase operational efficiencies by transforming every part of the value chain, such as logistics, communications, and operations. In a similar way that physical goods companies transformed how they design, build, and deliver products using industrial automation throughout the 20th century, companies in today’s world must transform how they build and deliver software.

## SysOps Vs. DevOps: What’s the Difference?

Those who are always confused with the terms 'SysOps' and 'DevOps' are definitely going to love this blog, Both DevOps and SysOps are incredible tools when used in apt situations. This blog explores these two important terms through a quick comparison.

## SysOps vs DevOps – What’s the Difference
 
### Introduction

If you are following the recent trends in the IT world, you must have heard about DevOps and SysOps. With all the attention they are getting these days, it’d be hard not to. Being familiar with these two terminologies is not enough if you are a techie or a programmer in this ever-evolving technological world. You are going to need to know a whole lot more, especially when you are interested in Cloud Computing. This blog will give you a basic introduction to both SysOps and DevOps, along with the key differences between the two.

****SysOps and DevOps**** re two very important concepts of Cloud Computing. When Cloud Computing came into existence, it fulfilled about 20 percent of a DBA’s work, almost 50 percent of a System Admin’s work and 80 percent of a Network Engineer’s work. Before the advent of cloud, businesses and IT organisations had to hire Testers, DBAs, Developers, Network Engineers, System Engineers, Operators, and what not to function, successfully. Thus with the evolution of cloud, the System Admins changed their working style. With less tasks and more time in their hands, they shifted to aiding developers in building business applications rather than shielding users and businesses from the mistakes of developers. This was the birth of DevOps.

To understand the differences between DevOps and SysOps, first you have to understand these two concepts individually.

DevOps and the application lifecycle
DevOps influences the application lifecycle throughout its plan, develop, deliver and operate phases. Each phase relies on the others and the phases are not role-specific. In a true DevOps culture, each role is involved in each phase to some extent.

![](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/cvt-927c0217634e78d8af70fc50828543d66bb89cc222e0615bc5c573b0b1ff1dab/images/page/overview/devops/index/lifecycle.png)


|plan|
|-----|
|In the plan phase, DevOps teams ideate, define, and describe features and capabilities of the applications and systems they are building. They track progress at low and high levels of granularity—from single-product tasks to tasks that span portfolios of multiple products. Creating backlogs, tracking bugs, managing agile software development with Scrum, using Kanban boards and visualising progress with dashboards are some of the ways DevOps teams plan with agility and visibility|.




------









|Develop|
|-------|
|The develop phase includes all aspects of coding—writing, testing, reviewing and the integration of code by team members—as well as building that code into build artifacts that can be deployed into various environments. DevOps teams seek to innovate rapidly without sacrificing quality, stability and productivity. To do that, they use highly productive tools, automate mundane and manual steps and iterate in small increments through automated testing and continuous integration|

--------.






|Deliver|
|--------|
|Delivery is the process of deploying applications into production environments in a consistent and reliable way. The deliver phase also includes deploying and configuring the fully governed foundational infrastructure that makes up those environments|.

|In the deliver phase, teams define a release management process with clear manual approval stages. They also set automated gates that move applications between stages until they’re made available to customers. Automating these processes makes them scalable, repeatable, controlled. This way, teams who practice DevOps can deliver frequently with ease, confidence and peace of mind.|

-------


|Operate|
|---------|
|The operate phase involves maintaining, monitoring and troubleshooting applications in production environments. In adopting DevOps practices, teams work to ensure system reliability, high availability and aim for zero downtime while reinforcing security and governance. DevOps teams seek to identify issues before they affect the customer experience and mitigate issues quickly when they do occur. Maintaining this vigilance requires rich telemetry, actionable alerting and full visibility into applications and the underlying system.|

DevOps culture
---------

- While adopting DevOps practices automates and optimises processes through technology, it all starts with the culture inside the organisation—and the people who play a part in it. The challenge of cultivating a DevOps culture requires deep changes in the way people work and collaborate. But when organisations commit to a DevOps culture, they can create the environment for high-performing teams to develop.

-----

####  Collaboration, visibility and alignment 
One hallmark of a healthy DevOps culture is collaboration between teams, which starts with visibility. Different teams such as development and IT operations must share their DevOps processes, priorities and concerns with each other. These teams must also plan work together as well as align on goals and measures of success as they relate to the business.

--------
#### Shifts in scope and accountability
As teams align, they take ownership and become involved in additional lifecycle phases—not just the ones central to their roles. For example, developers become accountable not only to the innovation and quality established in the develop phase, but also to the performance and stability their changes bring in the operate phase. At the same time, IT operators are sure to include governance, security and compliance in the plan and develop phase.

--------
#### Shorter release cycles
DevOps teams remain agile by releasing software in short cycles. Shorter release cycles make planning and risk management easier since progress is incremental, which also reduces the impact on system stability. Shortening the release cycle also allows organisations to adapt and react to evolving customer needs and competitive pressure.

----------
#### Continuous learning
High-performing DevOps teams establish a growth mindset. They fail fast and incorporate learnings into their processes, continually improving, increasing customer satisfaction and accelerating innovation and market adaptability. DevOps is a journey, so there is always room to grow.

# DevOpsCulture



Agile software development has broken down some of the silos between requirements analysis, testing and development. Deployment, operations and maintenance are other activities which have suffered a similar separation from the rest of the software development process. The DevOps movement is aimed at removing these silos and encouraging collaboration between development and operations.

DevOps has become possible largely due to a combination of new operations tools and established agile engineering practices [1], but these are not enough to realize the benefits of DevOps. Even with the best tools, DevOps is just another buzzword if you don't have the right culture.

The primary characteristic of DevOps culture is increased collaboration between the roles of development and operations. There are some important cultural shifts, within teams and at an organizational level, that support this collaboration.

DevOps requires an important cultural shift, within teams and in the               organization
An attitude of shared responsibility is an aspect of DevOps culture that encourages closer collaboration. It’s easy for a development team to become disinterested in the operation and maintenance of a system if it is handed over to another team to look after. If a development team shares the responsibility of looking after a system over the course of its lifetime, they are able to share the operations staff’s pain and so identify ways to simplify deployment and maintenance (e.g. by automating deployments and improving logging). They may also gain additional ObservedRequirements from monitoring the system in production. When operations staff share responsibility of a system’s business goals, they are able to work more closely with developers to better understand the operational needs of a system and help meet these. In practice, collaboration often begins with an increased awareness from developers of operational concerns (such as deployment and monitoring) and the adoption of new automation tools and practices by operations staff.

-------
Some organizational shifts are required to support a culture of shared responsibilities. There should be no silos between development and operations. Handover periods and documentation are a poor substitute for working together on a solution from the start. It is helpful to adjust resourcing structures to allow operations staff to get involved with teams early. Having the developers and operations staff co-located will help them to work together. Handovers and sign-offs discourage people from sharing responsibility and contributes to a culture of blame. Instead, developers and operations staff should both be responsible for the successes and failures of a system. DevOps culture blurs the line between the roles of developer and operations staff and may eventually eliminate the distinction. One common anti-pattern when introducing DevOps to an organization is to assign someone the role of 'DevOps' or to call a team a 'DevOps team'. Doing so perpetuates the kinds of silos that DevOps aims to break down and prevents DevOps culture and practices from spreading and being adopted by the wider organization.

Another valuable organizational shift is to support autonomous teams. In order to collaborate effectively, developers and operations staff need to be able to make decisions and apply changes without convoluted decision making processes. This involves trusting teams, changing the way risk is managed and creating an environment that is free of a fear of failure. For example, a team that has to produce a list of changes for sign-off in order to deploy to a testing environment is likely to be delayed frequently. Instead of requiring such a manual check, it is possible to rely on version control, which is fully auditable. Changes in version control can even be linked to tickets in the team's project management tool. Without the manual sign-off, the team can automate their deployments and speed up their testing cycle.

One effect of a shift towards DevOps culture is that it becomes easier to put new code in production. This necessitates some further cultural changes. In order to ensure that changes in production are sound, the team needs to value building quality into the development process. This includes cross-functional concerns such as performance and security. The techniques of ContinuousDelivery, including SelfTestingCode, form a basis which allows regular, low-risk deployments.

# The best DevOps tools 



### 1. Gradle

![](https://raygun.com/blog/images/best-devops-tools/gradle.png)

Your DevOps tool stack will need a reliable build tool. Apache Ant and Maven dominated the automated build tools market for many years, but Gradle showed up on the scene in 2009, and its popularity has steadily grown since then. Gradle is an incredibly versatile tool which allows you to write your code in Java, C++, Python, or other languages. Gradle is also supported by popular IDEs such as Netbeans, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA. If that doesn’t convince you, it might help to know that Google also chose it as the official build tool for Android Studio.

While Maven and Ant use XML for configuration, Gradle introduces a Groovy-based DSL for describing builds. In 2016, the Gradle team also released a Kotlin-based DSL, so now you can write your build scripts in Kotlin as well. This means that Gradle does have some learning curves, so it can help a lot if you have used Groovy, Kotlin or another JVM language before. Besides, Gradle uses Maven’s repository format, so dependency management will be familiar if you have prior experience with Maven. You can also import your Ant builds into Gradle.

The best thing about Gradle is incremental builds, as they save a nice amount of compile time. According to Gradle’s performance measurements, it’s up to 100 times faster than Maven. This is in part because of incrementality, but also due to Gradle’s build cache and daemon. The build cache reuses task outputs, while the Gradle Daemon keeps build information hot in memory in-between builds.

All in all, Gradle allows faster shipping and comes with a lot of configuration possibilities.

### 2. Git

![](https://raygun.com/blog/images/best-devops-tools/git.png)

Git is one of the most popular DevOps tools, widely used across the software industry. It’s a distributed SCM (source code management) tool, loved by remote teams and open source contributors. Git allows you to track the progress of your development work. You can save different versions of your source code and return to a previous version when necessary. It’s also great for experimenting, as you can create separate branches and merge new features only when they’re ready to go.

To integrate Git with your DevOps workflow, you also need to host repositories where your team members can push their work. Currently, the two best online Git repo hosting services are GitHub and Bitbucket. GitHub is more well-known, but Bitbucket comes with free unlimited private repos for small teams (up to five team members). With GitHub, you get access only to public repos for free—which is still a great solution for many projects.

Both GitHub and Bitbucket have fantastic integrations. For example, you can integrate them with Slack, so everyone on your team gets notified whenever someone makes a new commit.

### 3. Jenkins

![](https://raygun.com/blog/images/best-devops-tools/jenkins.png)

Jenkins is the go-to DevOps automation tool for many software development teams. It’s an open source CI/CD server that allows you to automate the different stages of your delivery pipeline. The main reason for Jenkins’ popularity is its huge plugin ecosystem. Currently, it offers more than 1,000 plugins, so it integrates with almost all DevOps tools, from Docker to Puppet.

With Jenkins, you can set up and customize your CI/CD pipeline according to your own needs. I found the following example in the Jenkins Docs. And, this is just one of the possibilities. Nice, isn’t it?

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a software development strategy which bridges the gap between the developers and the IT staff. With DevOps, organizations can release small features very quickly and incorporate the feedback which they receive, very quickly. Following are some other benefits:

### Fewer Software Failure
Shortened lead time between fixes
It overcomes all the limitations of the traditional waterfall model. DevOps process involves a lot of development, testing and deployment technologies for developing automated CI/ CD pipelines. Following are some of the famous DevOps tools:
Git and GitHub — Source code management (Version Control System)
Jenkins — Automation server, with plugins built for developing CI/ CD pipelines
Selenium — Automation testing
Docker — Software Containerization Platform
Kubernetes — Container Orchestration tool
Puppet — Configuration Management and Deployment
Chef — Configuration Management and Deployment
Ansible — Configuration Management and Deployment
Nagios — Continuous Monitoring
Now, let us understand who is a DevOps Engineer?


-----


## Who is a DevOps Engineer?
DevOps Engineer is somebody who understands the Software Development Lifecycle and has the outright understanding of various automation tools for developing digital pipelines (CI/ CD pipelines).
But the question still endures “ Who is a DevOps Engineer? “
DevOps Engineer works with developers and the IT staff to oversee the code releases. They are either developers who get interested in deployment and network operations or sysadmins who have a passion for scripting and coding and move into the development side where they can improve the planning of test and deployment.
