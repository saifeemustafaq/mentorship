DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

#### >How DevOps Works?

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.

Move at high velocity so you can innovate for customers faster, adapt to changing markets better, and grow more efficient at driving business results. The DevOps model enables your developers and operations teams to achieve these results. For example, microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.

Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster. The quicker you can release new features and fix bugs, the faster you can respond to your customers’ needs and build competitive advantage. Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy.

Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can reliably deliver at a more rapid pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users. Use practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each change is functional and safe. Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed of performance in real-time.

Build more effective teams under a DevOps cultural model, which emphasizes values such as ownership and accountability. Developers and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time (e.g. reduced handover periods between developers and operations, writing code that takes into account the environment in which it is run).

-----
****DevOps-What-is_security****
#### 6.Security

Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing security by using automated compliance policies, fine-grained controls, and configuration management techniques. For example, using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and then track compliance at scale.

#### Why DevOps Matters?

Software and the Internet have transformed the world and its industries, from shopping to entertainment to banking. Software no longer merely supports a business; rather it becomes an integral component of every part of a business. Companies interact with their customers through software delivered as online services or applications and on all sorts of devices. They also use software to increase operational efficiencies by transforming every part of the value chain, such as logistics, communications, and operations. In a similar way that physical goods companies transformed how they design, build, and deliver products using industrial automation throughout the 20th century, companies in today’s world must transform how they build and deliver software.

## SysOps Vs. DevOps: What’s the Difference?

Those who are always confused with the terms 'SysOps' and 'DevOps' are definitely going to love this blog, Both DevOps and SysOps are incredible tools when used in apt situations. This blog explores these two important terms through a quick comparison.

## SysOps vs DevOps – What’s the Difference
 
### Introduction

If you are following the recent trends in the IT world, you must have heard about DevOps and SysOps. With all the attention they are getting these days, it’d be hard not to. Being familiar with these two terminologies is not enough if you are a techie or a programmer in this ever-evolving technological world. You are going to need to know a whole lot more, especially when you are interested in Cloud Computing. This blog will give you a basic introduction to both SysOps and DevOps, along with the key differences between the two.

****SysOps and DevOps**** re two very important concepts of Cloud Computing. When Cloud Computing came into existence, it fulfilled about 20 percent of a DBA’s work, almost 50 percent of a System Admin’s work and 80 percent of a Network Engineer’s work. Before the advent of cloud, businesses and IT organisations had to hire Testers, DBAs, Developers, Network Engineers, System Engineers, Operators, and what not to function, successfully. Thus with the evolution of cloud, the System Admins changed their working style. With less tasks and more time in their hands, they shifted to aiding developers in building business applications rather than shielding users and businesses from the mistakes of developers. This was the birth of DevOps.

To understand the differences between DevOps and SysOps, first you have to understand these two concepts individually.

DevOps and the application lifecycle
DevOps influences the application lifecycle throughout its plan, develop, deliver and operate phases. Each phase relies on the others and the phases are not role-specific. In a true DevOps culture, each role is involved in each phase to some extent.

|plan|
|-----|
|In the plan phase, DevOps teams ideate, define, and describe features and capabilities of the applications and systems they are building. They track progress at low and high levels of granularity—from single-product tasks to tasks that span portfolios of multiple products. Creating backlogs, tracking bugs, managing agile software development with Scrum, using Kanban boards and visualising progress with dashboards are some of the ways DevOps teams plan with agility and visibility|.




------









|Develop|
|-------|
|The develop phase includes all aspects of coding—writing, testing, reviewing and the integration of code by team members—as well as building that code into build artifacts that can be deployed into various environments. DevOps teams seek to innovate rapidly without sacrificing quality, stability and productivity. To do that, they use highly productive tools, automate mundane and manual steps and iterate in small increments through automated testing and continuous integration|

--------.






|Deliver|
|--------|
|Delivery is the process of deploying applications into production environments in a consistent and reliable way. The deliver phase also includes deploying and configuring the fully governed foundational infrastructure that makes up those environments|.

|In the deliver phase, teams define a release management process with clear manual approval stages. They also set automated gates that move applications between stages until they’re made available to customers. Automating these processes makes them scalable, repeatable, controlled. This way, teams who practice DevOps can deliver frequently with ease, confidence and peace of mind.|

-------


|Operate|
|---------|
|The operate phase involves maintaining, monitoring and troubleshooting applications in production environments. In adopting DevOps practices, teams work to ensure system reliability, high availability and aim for zero downtime while reinforcing security and governance. DevOps teams seek to identify issues before they affect the customer experience and mitigate issues quickly when they do occur. Maintaining this vigilance requires rich telemetry, actionable alerting and full visibility into applications and the underlying system.|

DevOps culture
---------

- While adopting DevOps practices automates and optimises processes through technology, it all starts with the culture inside the organisation—and the people who play a part in it. The challenge of cultivating a DevOps culture requires deep changes in the way people work and collaborate. But when organisations commit to a DevOps culture, they can create the environment for high-performing teams to develop.

-----

####  Collaboration, visibility and alignment 
One hallmark of a healthy DevOps culture is collaboration between teams, which starts with visibility. Different teams such as development and IT operations must share their DevOps processes, priorities and concerns with each other. These teams must also plan work together as well as align on goals and measures of success as they relate to the business.

--------
#### Shifts in scope and accountability
As teams align, they take ownership and become involved in additional lifecycle phases—not just the ones central to their roles. For example, developers become accountable not only to the innovation and quality established in the develop phase, but also to the performance and stability their changes bring in the operate phase. At the same time, IT operators are sure to include governance, security and compliance in the plan and develop phase.

--------
#### Shorter release cycles
DevOps teams remain agile by releasing software in short cycles. Shorter release cycles make planning and risk management easier since progress is incremental, which also reduces the impact on system stability. Shortening the release cycle also allows organisations to adapt and react to evolving customer needs and competitive pressure.

----------
#### Continuous learning
High-performing DevOps teams establish a growth mindset. They fail fast and incorporate learnings into their processes, continually improving, increasing customer satisfaction and accelerating innovation and market adaptability. DevOps is a journey, so there is always room to grow.
