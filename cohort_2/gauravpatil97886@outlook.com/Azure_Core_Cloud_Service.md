#### TodayToday, cloud computing applications and platforms are rapidly growing across all industries, serving as the IT infrastructure that drives new digital businesses.
These platforms and applications have revolutionized the ways in which businesses function, and have made processes easier.
In fact, more than ****77 percent**** of businesses today have at least some portion of their computing infrastructure in the cloud.


#### While there are many cloud computing platforms available, two platforms dominate the cloud computing industry.
****Amazon Web Services (AWS)**** and Microsoft Azure are the two giants in the world of cloud computing.

####  While AWS is the largest cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure is the fastest-growing and second-largest.
This article focuses on Microsoft Azure and what is Azure—its services and uses. But before we delve into Microsoft Azure, 
here’s a look at everything you’ll find in this article:

### What is cloud computing?
### Why is cloud computing important?
### What is Azure?
### What are the various Azure services?
### What are the various uses of Azure?

####
Before diving into what is Azure, you should first know what cloud computing is.

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is a technology that provides access to various computing resources over the internet.
All you need to do is use your computer or mobile device to connect to your cloud service provider through the internet.
Once connected, you get access to computing resources, which may include serverless computing,
virtual machines, storage, and various other things.

- Basically, cloud service providers have massive data centers that contain hundreds of servers, storage systems and components that are crucial for many kinds of organizations. 
These data centers are in secure locations and store a large amount of data. 
The users connect to these data centers to collect data or use it when required. U
users can take advantage of various services; for example, if you want a notification every time someone sends you a text or an email, cloud services can help you. 
The best part about cloud platforms is that you pay only for the services you use, and there are no charges upfront.

- Cloud computing can be used for various purposes: machine learning, data analysis, storage and backup, streaming media content and so much more.
Here’s an interesting fact about the cloud: all the shows and movies that you see on Netflix are actually stored in the cloud.
Also, the cloud can be beneficial for creating and testing applications, automating software delivery, and hosting blogs.

## What is Microsoft Azure?
=====================================


-------
[Visit To Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/)
--------

- Azure is a cloud computing platform and an online portal that allows you to access and manage cloud services and resources provided by Microsoft.
These services and resources include storing your data and transforming it, depending on yo
ur requirements.
To get access to these resources and services, all you need to have is an active internet connection and the ability to connect to the Azure portal.

#### Things that you should know about Azure:

- It was launched on February 1, 2010, significantly later than its main competitor, AWS.

- It’s free to start and follows a pay-per-use model, which means you pay only for the services you opt for.

- Interestingly, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 companies use Azure services for their cloud computing needs.

- Azure supports multiple programming languages, ****including Java, Node Js, and C#****.

##### Another benefit of Azure is the number of data centers it has around the world. There are 42 Azure data centers spread around the globe,
which is the highest number of data centers for any cloud platform. Also, Azure is planning to get 12 more data centers, which will increase the number of data centers to 54, shortly.
Let’s now discuss what are the various Microsoft Azure services in the what is Azure article.

## Azure History :


- Microsoft first unveiled its plans to introduce a cloud computing service called Windows Azure in 2008. Preview versions of the service became available and developed, leading to its commercial launch in early 2010. Although early iterations of Azure cloud services fell behind more established offerings -- such as AWS -- the portfolio continued to evolve and support a larger base of programming languages, frameworks and operating systems. By early 2014, Microsoft recognized that the implications of cloud computing stretched far beyond Windows, and the service was rebranded as Microsoft Azure.

## Azure competition:

- Microsoft Azure is one of several major public cloud service providers operating on a large global scale. Other major providers include **Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS) and IBM**.

- Currently, there is a lack of standardization among cloud services and capabilities -- meaning no two cloud providers offer the same service in the exact same way, using the same APIs or integrations. This makes it difficult for a business to use more than one public cloud provider when pursuing a **multi-cloud strategy**. Third-party cloud management tools can reduce some of these challenges.


-------

## Azure pricing and costs:

- Similar to other public cloud providers, Azure primarily uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model that charges based on usage. However, if a single application uses multiple Azure services, each service might involve multiple pricing tiers. In addition, if a user makes a long-term commitment to certain services, such as compute instances, Microsoft offers a discounted rate.

- Given the many factors involved in cloud service pricing, an organization should review and manage its cloud usage to minimize costs. Azure-native tools, such as [Azure Cost Management](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Cloudyn?_gl=1*moxo6v*_ga*ZjIxLXFVS1N6UTJDWTh6eGl4SFpmLVdWMGY3RDBKd1ZvZ2JFUDlWM0VVb1FLYkFkaTZ3bzJySWFkQzJxaEVYUw) 
can help monitor, visualize and optimize cloud spending. It's also possible to use third-party tools, such as Cloudability or RightScale, to manage Azure resource usage and associated costs.

# Azure Privacy:
Microsoft has stated that, per the USA Patriot Act, the US government could have access to the data even if the hosted company is not American and the data resides outside the USA.[64] However, Microsoft Azure is compliant with the E.U. Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).[65][66][contradictory] To manage privacy and security-related concerns, Microsoft has created a Microsoft Azure Trust Center,[67] and Microsoft Azure has several of its services compliant with several compliance programs including ISO 27001:2005 and HIPAA. A full and current listing can be found on the Microsoft Azure Trust Center Compliance page.[68] Of special note, Microsoft Azure has been granted JAB Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) from the U.S. government in accordance with guidelines spelled out under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), a U.S. government program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud services used by the federal government.[69]........

### IaaS vs. PaaS options on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform
1
- looking to shift your workloads to the cloud? Understand and compare the IaaS and PaaS options on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform.
- Chris Tozzi, Fixate IO
- Published: 15 Oct 2019
- IaaS and PaaS are two of the oldest and most widely used categories of cloud computing services -- similar in some ways but still fundamentally different types of platforms.

- Enterprises must understand those differences in order to choose the right type of cloud service for a given use case. This article explains the benefits and drawbacks of IaaS vs. PaaS, and surveys the main IaaS and PaaS offerings available from AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

### > IaaS vs. PaaS, defined

-Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides on-demand access to virtualized IT infrastructure via the internet. Typically, IaaS provides access only to core infrastructure components -- compute, networking and storage. Users install and manage the software they want to run on their cloud-based infrastructure.

- Cloud providers maintain and monitor the physical infrastructure to deliver IaaS, [but it is the users' responsibility](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/opinion/Prepare-for-cloud-security-and-shared-responsibility?_ga=2.134965174.612744049.1592141776-f21-qUKSzQ2CY8zxixHZf-WV0f7D0JwVogbEP9V3EUoQKbAdi6wo2rIadC2qhEXS) to secure and monitor the workloads that run on that platform. Thus, the primary value of IaaS is that it eliminates the need for users to purchase, set up and maintain physical servers.

- Originally, IaaS was the backbone of major public clouds such as AWS, which released database and virtual machine hosting services in the mid-2000s. Only later did those vendors add service options that enabled enterprises to focus more on development rather than management.

## > Microsoft Azure Features

- Microsoft Azure Web Sites is a web-hosting platform that supports multiple technologies, and programming languages (.NET, node.js, PHP, Python).[8] Users with Microsoft Azure subscriptions can create Websites, and deploy content and code into the Web sites. Microsoft Azure Web Sites supports a website creation wizard which allows the user to create a blank site, or create a site based on one of several available pre-configured images from the website gallery.[9][10]

- As part of creating the website, the site's URL is assigned a subdomain of azurewebsites.net. In various for-pay tiers, a website can be assigned one or more custom domains. This is implemented by setting a CNAME record on the DNS server that hosts the user's domain's zone to point at the user's web site hosted in Azure.[11] On some for-pay tiers, the user has the added option of uploading an SSL certificate and configuring his site to be bound to HTTPS.[12]

- Once a site has been created, the user can add or modify its content using multiple deployment methods, including Web Deploy (MSDeploy), [TFS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_DevOps_Server), (via Visual Studio), [FTP](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) , FTPS, [WebMatrix](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_WebMatrix) , ****CodePlex, GitHub, Dropbox, Bitbucket, Mercurial and local Git.[13]

## Why are people trusting their workloads to Microsoft Azure?

|It’s been said that the on-premise data center has no future. Like mainframes and dial-up modems before them, self-hosted data centers are becoming obsolete, being replaced by increasingly available and affordable cloud solutions. Several important players have emerged in the cloud service sphere, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), perennial computing giant IBM, and Apple’s ubiquitous iCloud, which holds the picture memories and song preferences of hundreds of millions of smartphone users, among other data. With so many options, why are companies like 3M, BMW, and GE moving workloads to Microsoft Azure? Just some of the reasons:|


#### Flexibility

With Microsoft Azure you can spin up new services and geometrically scale your data storage capabilities on the fly. Compare this to a static data center, which would require new hardware and OS purchasing, provisioning, and deployment before additional power could be brought to bear against your IT challenges. This modern flexibility makes Azure a tempting solution for organizations of any size.


--------

#### Cost

Azure solutions don’t just make it faster and easier to add and scale infrastructure, they make it cheaper. Physical services and infrastructure devices like routers, load balancers and more quickly add up to thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Then there’s the IT expertise required to run this equipment, which amounts to major payroll overhead. By leveraging Microsoft’s massive infrastructure and expertise, Azure can trim our annual IT budget by head-turning percentages.

-------
#### Applications

With a la carte service offerings like Visual Studio Team Services, Visual Studio Application Insights, and Azure’s scalable, on-demand storage for both frequently accessed and ‘cold’ data, Microsoft makes developing and testing mission-critical apps a snap. Move an application from test to production mode on the fly across a globally distributed network. Microsoft also offers substantial licensing discounts for migrating their existing apps to Azure, which represents even more opportunity for savings.


-----


#### Disaster recovery

Sometimes the unthinkable becomes the very immediate reality. Another advantage of Microsoft Azure lay in its high-speed and geographically decentralized infrastructure, which creates limitless options for disaster recovery plans. Ensure that your critical application and data can run from redundant sites during recovery periods that last minutes or hours instead of days. Lost time is lost business, and with Azure you can guarantee continuous service delivery even when disaster strikes.

The combination of Microsoft’s vast infrastructure, constant application and services development, and powerful presence in the global IT marketplace has made Microsoft Azure solutions the choice of two-thirds of the world’s Fortune 500 companies. But the infinite scalability of Azure can make it just as right for your small personal business.

## Is Your Future in the Cloud?


![](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/Emerging-Technologies-Enabled-by-the-Cloud.jpg)


The above is only a quick rundown of a few of the ways cloud computing enables and even drives emerging technologies. For you as a prospective cloud professional, it’s obviously a fortuitous time to move into cloud computing…or to move up the ladder if you’re already there. The job demand is strong yet the pool of qualified candidates is small: 46 percent of firms see the skills gap growing primarily because 96 percent of workers lack advanced skills. And with these new technologies emerging, new jobs will be created every day: Cloud is the second biggest driver of demand for technology skills, and these cloud computing jobs pay very well: For proof, see this list of 12 cloud computing jobs that pay over $113,000 per year. The salary for a cloud architect averaged $142,000 in October 2018.


## Conclusion
If you’d like to move your future into the cloud, turn to Simplilearn Cloud Computing courses for a head start. We offer certifications and courses in AWS, Azure, blockchain, Google Cloud, Kubernetes and more—much more. Study to be a cloud architect, get to know blockchain or focus on one vendor like Azure. Courses are available for anywhere, anytime learning so you can set the pace and study while keeping up with your current job, while plenty of hands-on projects make the learning stick.

We already have a disturbing lack of qualified cloud computing professionals, and the cloud’s role in enabling and driving emerging technologies will no doubt create even more jobs in the coming years. Make your career move into this field, and watch your career evolve right alongside the cloud

A cloud allows users to access application, information, and data of all sorts on an online level rather than by use of actual hardware or devices. A company offering reliable cloud technology allows for computing to be done in a much more shared way, as a cloud provides a service rather than a product. Users get and share their information in a way that can allow them to access and give access to the whole world or any groups of people within their cloud.
