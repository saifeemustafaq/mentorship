# Q.3.What is Markdown Language.

+ **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[9] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

+ Since the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, the implementations that appeared over the years have subtle differences and many come with syntax extensions.

+ **History of markdown language**
+ John Gruber created the Markdown language in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax,[2][3] with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, optionally convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".[4]

+ Its key design goal is readability – that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it has been marked up with tags or formatting instructions,[10] unlike text formatted with a markup language, such as Rich Text Format (RTF) or HTML, which have obvious tags and formatting instructions. To this end, its main inspiration is the existing conventions for marking up plain text in email, though it also draws from earlier markup languages, notably setext, Textile, and reStructuredText.[10]

+ Gruber wrote a Perl script, Markdown.pl, which converts marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML or HTML and replaces angle brackets '<' '>' and ampersands '&' with their corresponding character entity references. It can be used as a standalone script, as a plugin for Blosxom or Movable Type, or as a text filter for BBEdit.[4]

+ Markdown has since been re-implemented by others e.g. in a Perl module available on CPAN (Text::Markdown), and in a variety of other programming languages.[11] It is distributed under a BSD-style license and is included with, or available as a plugin for, several content-management systems.[7][12][13]

+ Sites like GitHub, Bitbucket, Reddit, Diaspora, Stack Exchange, OpenStreetMap, and SourceForge use variants of Markdown to facilitate discussion between users.[14][15][16][17]

# About virtual machine  :::
- In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.


> #### There are different kinds of virtual machineseach with different functions****

- 1 . **System virtual machines** :also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.

- 2 .**Process virtual machines**> are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.
Some virtual machines, such as QEMU, are designed to also emulate different architectures and allow execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture. Operating-system-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel. The terms are not universally interchangeable.

# Working of virtual machine :
- Multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously on the same physical computer. For servers, the multiple operating systems run side by side with a piece of software called a hypervisor to manage them, while desktop computers typical employ one operating system to run the other operating systems within its program windows. Each virtual machine provides its own virtual hardware, including CPUs, memory, hard drives, network interfaces, and other devices. The virtual hardware is then mapped to the real hardware on the physical machine which saves costs by reducing the need for physical hardware systems along with the associated maintenance costs that go with it, plus reduces power and cooling demand.

----------------

  # Advantage of virtual machine:
  - Multiple OS environments can exist simultaneously on the same machine, isolated from each other;
  
- Virtual machine can offer an instruction set architecture that differs from real computer's;

- Easy maintenance, application provisioning, availability and convenient recovery.
- When you create your virtual machine, you create a virtual hard disk. So, everything on that machine can crash, but if it does, it won’t affect the host machine.

- There are security benefits to running virtual machines. For example, if you need to run an application of questionable security, you can run it in a guest operating system. So, if the application causes damage, then it will be only temporary after the guest is shut down. Virtual machines also allow for better security forensics by monitoring guest operating systems for deficiencies and allowing the user to quarantine it for analysis.

--------------------

# Disadvantage of virtual machine:
- Virtual machines are less efficient than real machines because they access the hardware indirectly. Running software on top of the host operating system means that it will have to request access to the hardware from the host. That will slow the usability.

- When several virtual machines are running on the same host, performance may be hindered if the computer it’s running on lacks sufficient power. Your virtual machine still uses the resources of your host machine. The more powerful the host computer, the more quickly the virtual machine will run.

- A virtual machine can be infected with the weaknesses of the host machine. As an example, process isolation is a feature usually employed by operating systems. However, there are bugs that violate it. A regular computer devoid of virtual machines would then only be affected. But, a computer with a number of virtual machines would then infect each of those “machines” as well.

-------------------

 ## benefits of cloud computing:
 Benefits of cloud computing
Cloud computing offers your business many benefits. It allows you to set up what is essentially a virtual office to give you the flexibility of connecting to your business anywhere, any time. With the growing number of web-enabled devices used in today's business environment (e.g. smartphones, tablets), access to your data is even easier.

There are many benefits to moving your business to the cloud:

Reduced IT costs
Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems. Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider. You may be able to reduce your operating costs because:

the cost of system upgrades, new hardware and software may be included in your contract
you no longer need to pay wages for expert staff
your energy consumption costs may be reduced
there are fewer time delays.
Scalability
Your business can scale up or scale down your operation and storage needs quickly to suit your situation, allowing flexibility as your needs change. Rather than purchasing and installing expensive upgrades yourself, your cloud computer service provider can handle this for you. Using the cloud frees up your time so you can get on with running your business.

#### Business continuity :

- Protecting your data and systems is an important part of business continuity planning. Whether you experience a natural disaster, power failure or other crisis, having your data stored in the cloud ensures it is backed up and protected in a secure and safe location. Being able to access your data again quickly allows you to conduct business as usual, minimising any downtime and loss of productivity.

------------------
##### Collaboration efficiency :

- Collaboration in a cloud environment gives your business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of the traditional methods. If you are working on a project across different locations, you could use cloud computing to give employees, contractors and third parties access to the same files. You could also choose a cloud computing model that makes it easy for you to share your records with your advisers (e.g. a quick and secure way to share accounting records with your accountant or financial adviser).

----------------

#### Flexibility of work practices :

- Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices. For example, you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection). If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily.

----------------

#### Access to automatic updates :

- Access to automatic updates for your IT requirements may be included in your service fee. Depending on your cloud computing service provider, your system will regularly be updated with the latest technology. This could include up-to-date versions of software, as well as upgrades to servers and computer processing power.

------------------

# Solid-State drive (SSD):
- A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage. It is also sometimes called a solid-state device or a solid-state disk,[1] even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read–write heads used in hard drives ("HDD") or floppy disks.[

----------------

# software design description(SDD) :

-  IEEE 1016-1998, also known as the Recommended Practice for Software Design Descriptions, is an IEEE standard that specifies an organizational structure for a software design description (SDD). An SDD is a document used to specify system architecture and application design in a software related project.

- A software design description (a.k.a. software design document or SDD; just design document; also Software Design Specification) is a written description of a software product, that a software designer writes in order to give a software development team overall guidance to the architecture of the software project.


------------------
# Types of clouds :

## Types of Cloud Deployment:
Cloud deployment describes the way a cloud platform is implemented, how it’s hosted, and who has access to it. All cloud computing deployments operate on the same principle by virtualizing the computing power of servers into segmented, software-driven applications that provide processing and storage capabilities.

-----------------

## Public Cloud :
Some public cloud examples include those offered by Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. These companies provide both services and infrastructure, which are shared by all customers. Public clouds typically have massive amounts of available space, which translates into easy scalability. A public cloud is often recommended for software development and collaborative projects. Companies can design their applications to be portable, so that a project that’s tested in the public cloud can be moved to the private cloud for production. Most cloud providers package their computing resources as part of a service. Public cloud examples range from access to a completely virtualized infrastructure that provides little more than raw processing power and storage (Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS) to specialized software programs that are easy to implement and use (Software as a Service, or SaaS). 

- The great advantage of a public cloud is its versatility and “pay as you go” structure that allows customers to provision more capacity on demand. On the downside, the essential infrastructure and operating system of the public cloud remain under full control of the cloud provider. Customers may continue to use the platform under the terms and conditions laid out by the provider, but they may have difficulty repatriating their assets if they want to change providers. Should the provider go out of business or make significant changes to the platform, customers could be forced to make significant infrastructure changes on short notice.

-----------------

## Private Cloud :
Private clouds usually reside behind a firewall and are utilized by a single organization. A completely on-premises cloud may be the preferred solution for businesses with very tight regulatory requirements, though private clouds implemented through a colocation provider are gaining in popularity. Authorized users can access, utilize, and store data in the private cloud from anywhere, just like they could with a public cloud. The difference is that no one else can access or utilize those computing resources. Private cloud solutions offer both security and control, but these benefits come at a cost. The company that owns the cloud is responsible for both software and infrastructure, making this a less economical model than the public cloud.

- The additional control offered by a private cloud makes it easier to restrict access to valuable assets and ensures that a company will be able to move its data and applications where it wants, whenever it wants. Furthermore, since the private cloud isn’t controlled by an outside vendor, there’s no risk of sudden changes disrupting the company’s entire infrastructure. A private cloud solution will also not be affected by a public cloud provider’s system downtime. But private clouds also lack the versatility of public clouds. They can only be expanded by adding more physical compute and storage capacity, making it difficult to scale operations quickly should the business need arise.

--------------

## Hybrid Cloud :
Hybrid clouds combine public clouds with private clouds. They are designed to allow the two platforms to interact seamlessly, with data and applications moving seamlessly from one to the other. 

The primary advantage of a hybrid cloud model is its ability to provide the scalable computing power of a public cloud with the security and control of a private cloud. Data can be stored safely behind the firewalls and encryption protocols of the private cloud, then moved securely into a public cloud environment when needed. This is especially helpful in the age of big data analytics, when industries like healthcare must adhere to strict data privacy regulations while also using sophisticated algorithms powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to derive actionable insights from huge masses of unstructured data. 

There are two commonly used types of hybrid cloud architecture. Cloudbursting uses a private cloud as its primary cloud, storing data and housing proprietary applications in a secure environment. When service demands increase, however, the private cloud’s infrastructure may not have the capacity to keep up. That’s where the public cloud comes in. A cloudbursting model uses the public cloud’s computing resources to supplement the private cloud, allowing the company to handle increased traffic without having to purchase new servers or other infrastructure.

The second type of hybrid cloud model also runs most applications and houses data in a private cloud environment, but outsources non-critical applications to a public cloud provider. This arrangement is common for organizations that need to access specialized development tools (like Adobe Creative Cloud), basic productivity software (like Microsoft Office 365), or CRM platforms (like Salesforce). Multi-cloud architecture is often deployed here, incorporating multiple cloud service providers to meet a variety of unique organizational needs.

---------------

## Qn.What is a Multi-Cloud Model?
- In some cases, a single public cloud isn’t enough to meet an organization’s computing needs. They turn instead to multi-clouds, a more complex hybrid cloud example that combines a private cloud with multiple public cloud services. While a hybrid cloud always consists of a public and private cloud, a multi-cloud environment is a bit more varied on a case-to-case basis. In this arrangement, an organization’s IT infrastructure consists of multiple public clouds from multiple providers, although it may access those clouds through a single software-defined network. A private cloud could certainly be part of a multi-cloud architecture, but it is usually more isolated from its public cloud counterparts.

- The purpose of a multi-cloud model is versatility and specialization. In enterprise-level organizations, for example, not every department has the same cloud needs. A marketing department, for instance, needs different types of cloud computing tools than a research or human resources department. Rather than trying to create a one-size-fits-all solution, companies can pick and choose from existing public cloud providers to ensure that each department has a solution catered to their specific needs.

- ****Multi-cloud models**** also offer reassurance because they don’t leave organizations dependent upon a single cloud provider. This can decrease costs and increase flexibility in the long run while also avoiding the problem of vendor lock-in. When combined with private cloud assets, multi-cloud deployments allow organizations to accomplish multiple goals at one time without having to radically expand or rethink their existing infrastructure.

- LinkedIn is a valuable resource for career and business professionals to network; obtain resources and support; and build relationships with potential customers, clients, and partners. It's ideal for home-based business owners, freelancers, and telecommuters, as it can help them build their business and career, as well as stay connected to the outside world.
--------
-  ****hiring are looking at your profile on LinkedIn****. In fact, if you’re not on LinkedIn, it may lead them to speculate why. For example, are you not Internet savvy? If you’re looking for a job, it’s expected you’ll be on LinkedIn.
-------
- ****LinkedIn has extensive job listings.*** If you’re looking for work, you can take advantage of LinkedIn’s job search engine. Many top brands are using LinkedIn as a way to find suitable candidates through job listings, and there are plenty of listings exclusive to LinkedIn.
------
- ****Receive (and give) endorsements and testimonials.**** LinkedIn enables your peers to endorse your skills and write up recommendations, and you can do the same for them. People who are searching for networking connections or job candidates will take these recommendations into consideration.

-------
- ****Make important business connections.**** You get to choose whom to ­connect with on LinkedIn. For example, you can connect with past co-workers, employers, and Fortune 500 executives. You never know who will accept your invitation.
-------
###### Join professional groups that include like‐minded people. LinkedIn hosts thousands of online groups, enabling professionals to network within their respective niches.
--------
###### Reach out to the people who are viewing your profile. LinkedIn tells you who’s viewing your profile, which opens the door when it comes to meeting new people and making important connections. For example, if someone you’re interested in working with has viewed your profile, you can contact him, saying, “I noticed you viewed my profile. I’d love to chat.”
-------
###### Updating an online resume’s is easier than continuously updating a paper resume’s. With LinkedIn, you don’t have to worry about hiring a professional resume’s writer or formatting documents. You just have to click the Edit button and enter your desired information. The formatting is done for you. (However, you still have to worry about spelling and grammar.)
--------
###### Establish your expertise by using the LinkedIn content platform. LinkedIn invites users to create content, as well. Posting articles on LinkedIn can help to establish your expertise.

------
###### Read news from your connections. Your connections post news, tips, and updates, which you can look over to stay current on industry trends and timely topics.

# Qn.What is Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx).

#### Ans.>>>>
- 1. CapEx refers to a Capital expenditure while OpEx refers to an Operational expenditure. Capital expenditure is incurred when a business acquires assets that could be beneficial beyond the current tax year. For instance, it might buy brand new equipment or buildings. Also, it could upgrade an existing asset to boost its value beyond the current tax year. CapEx is also known as a Capital expense.



- 2. Operational expenditure consists of those expenses that a business incurs to run smoothly every single day. They are the costs that a business incurs while in the process of turning its inventory into an end product. Hence, depreciation of fixed assets that are used in the production process is considered OpEx expenditure. OpEx is also known as an operating expenditure, revenue expenditure or an operating expense.

- 3. Understanding CapEx vs OpEx difference is crucial for any business struggling to optimally utilise finance by making sure that the correct mode is used for capital expenses and other types of expenses. Below you will find a complete guide to Capex vs Opex, explaining the benefits and disadvantages of both, and how to manage them effectively.

 # Qn.What are the Types of cloud services .
 
 #### ans.
 ###### **IaaS**
 
- Think of IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service, as the foundation of cloud service. Thus, it is the most important level because it is the base that helps power everything else. IaaS does not include an operating system or any software applications, but serves as the infrastructure that supports these systems and programs.

- IaaS can include virtual computers, storage capacity, virtual networks, firewalls and much more. For example, if you need email service for your business, you might choose to implement IaaS from a cloud service provider that you can use to host and run any email application of your choosing. Infrastructure as a Service lays the groundwork for hosting hardware, software, storage and other applications chosen by the customer.

- Without IaaS, there is nowhere for the resources we'll see in PaaS and SaaS to live.

###### **PaaS**

- Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated ...
 
 
 ###### **SaaS**
 
 - Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.
 --------
 
 # Qn. What is a region?
 
 ##### ans
- The simplest explanation is that a “cloud region” describes the actual, real-life geographic location where your public cloud resources are located.

- It’s a common misconception that the “cloud” is just that—an intangible, ethereal storage space that exists only as a concept somewhere in the sky. But the cloud is just a prettier name for actual devices that process data. They’re data centers, and those data centers live in places.

- When you choose a cloud provider, you’re also choosing a “region,” which is where your data centers physically exist. However, while providers all define what a region is in a similar way, they differ in implementation.

### Qn. What is an Availability Zone?

### Qn. What is a region pair?


-------

# Qn. What is an Availability Zone?

- ans >>>>
- An Availability Zone is a high-availability offering that protects your applications and data from datacenter failures. Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. To ensure resiliency, there's a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from datacenter failures. Zone-redundant services replicate your applications and data across Availability Zones to protect from single-points-of-failure. With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA. The full Azure SLA explains the guaranteed availability of Azure as a whole.

- ****An Availability Zone in an Azure region is a combination of a fault domain and an update domain. For example, if you create three or more VMs across three zones in an Azure region, your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains. The Azure platform recognizes this distribution across update domains to make sure that VMs in different zones are not updated at the same time.

-  Build high-availability into your application architecture by co-locating your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within a zone and replicating in other zones. Azure services that support Availability Zones fall into two categories:

- Zonal services – where a resource is pinned to a specific zone (for example, virtual machines, managed disks, Standard IP addresses), or
- Zone-redundant services – when the Azure platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
- To achieve comprehensive business continuity on Azure, build your application architecture using the combination of Availability Zones with Azure region pairs. You can synchronously replicate your applications and data using Availability Zones within an Azure region for high-availability and asynchronously replicate across Azure regions for disaster recovery protection.

----------
# Qn. What is a region pair?

- ans>>>>
- An Azure region consists of a set of data centers deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated low-latency network. This ensures that Azure services within an Azure region offer the best possible performance and security.

- An Azure geography defines an area of the world containing at least one Azure region. Geographies define a discrete market, typically containing two or more regions, that preserve data residency and compliance boundaries. Find more information about Azure's global infrastructure here

- A regional pair consists of two regions within the same geography. Azure serializes platform updates (planned maintenance) across regional pairs, ensuring that only one region in each pair updates at a time. If an outage affects multiple regions, at least one region in each pair will be prioritized for recovery.

****AzureGeography***

Some Azure services take further advantage of paired regions to ensure business continuity and to protect against data loss. Azure provides several storage solutions that take advantage of paired regions to ensure data availability. For example, Azure Geo-redundant Storage (GRS) replicates data to a secondary region automatically, ensuring that data is durable even in the event that the primary region isn't recoverable.

Note that not all Azure services automatically replicate data, nor do all Azure services automatically fall-back from a failed region to its pair. In such cases, recovery and replication must be configured by the customer.

# Cloud Storage:
------
[visit to Microsoft Azure Cloud Storage Review ](https://cloudstorageadvice.com/microsoft-azure-review/)
------

- Cloud services have become the most suitable option for storing data online digitally.

- In the earlier times, most of the companies used to depend on their private servers for storing their growing collection of data and online files; but today storing data online on cloud servers is the next big thing as it allows unlimited storage.

- The best thing about storing all the data in the cloud is that it ensures affordability and the data can be easily accessed from anywhere in the world.

--------

## Benefits of online data storage in the cloud:


### Usability And Accessibility
- Users can easily upload the files in the cloud storage.
- It is easy to save all the files and data in the cloud, no technical knowledge is required for this purpose.

## Scaling in Cloud Computing:
--------
- Scaling is the ability of a company or organisation to handle increasing or decreasing demands in a capable manner, so that the coustomers or the company itself don't face any issue because of the fluctuating demands.
- Thus, scalability is a planned level of capacity that can grow or shrink as needed.
- There are 3 ways to Scale in cloud.
------
-----
### 1st] Vertical Scaling(Up scaling):
------
- With Cloud computing, you can add or subtract resources, like storage or processing power.
- You can take a example of a Multi-level parking lot.
- There's almost countless space, that vehicles can occupy anytime. Mostly there's alot of space available as the place is almost never completely occupied, as long as the capacity is not exceeded.
- Similarly changes can be made in your Vm as per the need.
- This is Vertical Scaling
--------

### 2nd] Horizontal Scaling(Out Scaling):
--------
- Horizontal scaling refers to adding more servers to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling.
- This method take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together.
- You can also handle traffic efficiently and execute complex workloads.
------

### 3rd] Diagonal Scaling(Mixed Scaling):

- When we combine Horizontalal and Vertical Scalinng together, We get Diagonal Scaling.
- It is the most efficient infrastructure scaling.
- It is simply increasing the resources of our existing servers untill it reaches it's limit.
- Then we can add more servers to our infrastructure and continue with our process.
-------

#### Takeaway:

- We experience great amount of flexibility that saves both money and time for a business.
- Cloud computing uses a pay-as-you-go model.
- This on-demand nature is what makes the cloud so easy and intresting.
-------

------
### What is Latency in Cloud Computing?
-------
- Cloud service latency is the delay of time between a client request and a cloud service provider’s response.
- ****Let's take a example:
- Imagine you went to a restaurant and order something.
- There's a time delay in preparing the dish, and serving it to your table.

****This is Latency***

- Also, Buffering delays of online video streaming is Latency.
- We as a Client request some service or something to the Cloud provider and in return the provider fulfills our request.
- Latency greatly affects how usable and enjoyable devices and communication requests are.
- We as customers certainly wish our Client reqests get solved within no time.
- It is the time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another in networking.
--------
-------
### Load balancing in Cloud Computing:
--------
- Cloud load balancing is defined as the method of splitting workloads and computing properties in a cloud computing.
- It helps companies to manage workload demands or application demands by distributing resources among numerous computers, networks or servers.
- The traffic on the internet grows rapidly, hence, the workload on the server grows fast which leads to the overloading of servers in various Organisations.
- There are two methords to overcome the problem of overloading on the servers-
- First is a single-server solution in which the server is upgraded to a higher performance server.
- But the new server may also be overloaded soon, demanding another upgrade.
Also the upgrading process is arduous and expensive.
- Second is a multiple-server solution in which a scalable service system on a cluster of servers is built.
- ****It is more cost effective as well as more scalable to build a server cluster system for network services****.
--------
--------
### Importance of Load Balancing
------

#### Better Performance:
- Load balancing techniques are less expensive and easy to implement as compared to its other options available.
Organizations can work on their client's applications much more faster and deliver better performance at relatively lower costs.
--------
#### Maintain Website Traffic:

- Cloud Balancing provides scalability to control website traffic.
- With the help of effective load balancers, you can easily manage high-end user traffic with the servers and network devices.
- Cloud balancing plays a crucial role for e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart, who are dealing with millions of visitors every single second.
- Load balancers help them distribute and manage workloads at the time of promotional and sale offers.
------
#### Handle Sudden Traffic Burst:

- Load balancers have this ability to handle any sudden traffic received at a particular time.
****For example**** a College or University website can shut down during result declaration due to too many requests arrivals at the same time.
- If they are using load balancers they do not have to worry about any amount of traffic burst.
- No matter how big is the traffic, load balancers equally divide entire website load into different servers for maximum results in a ***minimum response time****..
-----
#### Flexibility:

- The main objective of using a load balancer is to protect the website from a sudden shutdown.
- When the workload is distributed among a number of servers, even if one of them fails, the load could be shifted to another one.
- ****This shows scalability, flexibility and the handling ability of traffic****

# What is Latency?

-  Let’s look into how latency actually works and how, as a user, you’re usually impacted by it. Consider that you are buying a product through an online shop and you press the “Add to Cart” button for a product that you like.

- The chain of events that occur when you press that button are:

****You press the “Add to Cart” button****
1. The browser identifies this as an event and initiates a request to the website’s servers. The clock for latency starts now.
2.he request travels to the site’s server with all the relevant information.
3.The site’s server acknowledges the request and the first half of the latency is completed.
4.The request gets accepted or rejected and processed.
5.The site’s server replies to the request with relevant information.
6.The request reaches your browser and the product gets added to your cart. With this, the latency cycle is completed.
7.The time it takes for all these events to complete is known as latency.




--------

## Latency vs bandwidth vs throughput.

The performance of your network and application depend on latency, bandwidth, and throughput, but it’s important not to confuse one with the other.

Bandwidth is the amount of data that can pass through a network at any given time. Consider bandwidth as how narrow or wide a pipe is. A wider pipe allows for more data to be pushed through. Throughput, on the other hand, is the amount of data that can be transferred over a given period of time.

An efficient network connection is comprised of low latency and high bandwidth. This allows for maximum throughput. The bandwidth can only be increased by a finite amount as latency will eventually create a bottleneck and limit the amount of data that can be transferred over time.

### >Examples of Latency
High latency can adversely affect the performance of your network and greatly reduce how quickly your application communicates with users. A content delivery network allows customers to reach their users in the most efficient manner possible. These delivery channels greatly reduce the network lag between the user and the application.

You can check the network latency of your internet connection with any website by passing its web address or IP address in the command prompt on a Windows or Mac. Here is an example of the command prompt on Windows:

------
C:\Users\username>ping www.google.com

Pinging www.google.com [172.217.19.4] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 172.217.19.4: bytes=32 time=47ms TTL=52
Reply from 172.217.19.4: bytes=32 time=45ms TTL=52
Reply from 172.217.19.4: bytes=32 time=47ms TTL=52
Reply from 172.217.19.4: bytes=32 time=43ms TTL=52

Ping statistics for 172.217.19.4:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 43ms, Maximum = 47ms, Average = 45ms
    
------
    
Here you can see the result of pinging [](www.google.com) The statistics show that the average time it takes for a roundtrip between the given PC and Google’s network is 39ms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. 

------
### Can machines think? — Alan Turing, 1950

Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?" 

Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.   

what is artificial intelligenceAt it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human intelligence in machines.

The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.  

The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent?

In their groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii)

Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different approaches that have historically defined the field of AI: 

---------
#### Thinking humanly
#### Thinking rationally
#### Acting humanly 
#### Acting rationally

--------
The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior. Norvig and Russell focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome, noting "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel and Norvig 4).

Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science at MIT, defines AI as  "algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together

While these definitions may seem abstract to the average person, they help focus the field as an area of computer science and provide a blueprint for infusing machines and programs with machine learning and other subsets of artificial intelligence. 

While addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017,  DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin began his speech by offering the following definition of how AI is used today:

****"AI is a computer system**** able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence... Many of these artificial intelligence systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them are powered by very boring things like rules."

# Microsoft Security Essentials

(MSE) is an antivirus software (AV) that provides protection against different types of malicious software, such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits, and trojan horses. Prior to version 4.5, MSE ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7, but not on Windows 8 and later versions, which have built-in AV components known as Windows Defender. MSE 4.5 and later versions do not run on Windows XP. The license agreement allows home users and small businesses to install and use the product free-of-charge. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free Windows Defender, which only protected users from spyware until Windows 8


Built upon the same scanning engine and virus definitions as other Microsoft antivirus products, it provides real-time protection, constantly monitoring activities on the computer, scanning new files as they are created or downloaded, and disabling detected threats. It lacks the OneCare personal firewall and the Forefront Endpoint Protection centralized management features.

Microsoft's announcement of its own AV software on November 18, 2008, was met with mixed reactions from the AV industry. Symantec, McAfee and Kaspersky Lab—three competing independent software vendors—dismissed it as an unworthy competitor, but AVG Technologies and Avast Software appreciated its potential to expand the consumers' choice of AV software. AVG, McAfee, Sophos and Trend Micro claimed that the integration of the product into Microsoft Windows would be a violation of competition law.

The product received generally positive reviews praising its user interface, low resource usage and freeware license. It secured AV-TEST certification in October 2009, having demonstrated its ability to eliminate all widely encountered malware. It lost that certification in October 2012; in June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. However, Microsoft significantly improved this product during the couple of years preceding February 2018, when MSE achieved AV-TEST's "Top Product" award after detecting 80% of the samples used during its test. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist OPSWAT, MSE was the most popular AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several rogue antivirus programs that try to impersonate it.
