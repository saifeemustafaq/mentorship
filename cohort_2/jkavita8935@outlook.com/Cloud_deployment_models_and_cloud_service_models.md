## Date: June 7, 2020

 
 ### There are three different cloud deployment models. A cloud deployment model defines where your data is stored and how your customers interact with it – how do they get to it, and where do the applications run? It also depends on how much of your own infrastructure you want or need to manage.

 **According to NIST, there are four cloud deployment models:**

***1. Public cloud***
 
 ***2. Private cloud***
 
 ***3. Hybrid cloud***
 
  ***4. Community Cloud***

 # Public cloud :
 
#### This is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date – everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware. In some cases, you can save additional costs by sharing computing resources with other cloud users. 
 #### Businesses can use multiple public cloud providers of varying scale. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud provider.
 
 **Public Cloud model** offers high scalability, automated maintenance but more vulnerable to attacks due to high levels of accessibility.

## ***Advantages :-***

 - High scalability/agility – you don't have to buy a new server in order to scale.
 
 - Pay-as-you-go pricing – you pay only for what you use, no CapEx costs.
 
 - You're not responsible for maintenance or updates of the hardware.
 
 - Minimal technical knowledge to set up and use - you can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure workloads are secure, safe, and highly available.
 
 
 ## ***Disadvantages :-***
 
 - There may be specific security requirements that cannot be met by using public cloud.
 
 - There may be government policies, industry standards, or legal requirements which public clouds cannot meet.
 
 - You don't own the hardware or services and cannot manage them as you may want to.
 
 - Unique business requirements, such as having to maintain a legacy application might be hard to meet.

 # Private Cloud :
 
 #### In a private cloud, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your organization. This offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users, but you remain completely responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software services you provide.
 #### The Private Cloud model offers great levels of security and control, though cost benefits ought to be sacrificed to some extent.
 
 **A private cloud** can provide cloud functionality to external customers as well, or to specific internal departments such as Accounting or Human Resources.

## ***Advantages :-***

 - You can ensure the configuration can support any scenario or legacy application.
 
 - You have control (and responsibility) over security.
 
 - Private clouds can meet strict security, compliance, or legal requirements.
 
## ***Disadvantages :-***

 - You have some initial CapEx costs and must purchase the hardware for startup and maintenance.
 
 - Owning the equipment limits the agility - to scale you must buy, install, and setup new hardware.
 
 - Private clouds require IT skills and expertise that's hard to come by.

 # Hybrid cloud :
 
#### A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location. For example, you could host a website in the public cloud and link it to a highly secure database hosted in your private cloud .
#### This is helpful when you have some things that cannot be put in the cloud, maybe for legal reasons. For example, you may have some specific pieces of data that cannot be exposed publicly which needs to be held in your private datacenter.

The companies using **Hybrid Cloud model** benefit with the security and control aspect of Private Cloud and off-hand management and cost benefits of Public Cloud.

## ***Advantages :-***

 - You can keep any systems running and accessible that use out-of-date hardware or an out-of-date operating system.
 
 - You have flexibility with what you run locally versus in the cloud.
 - You can take advantage of economies of scale from public cloud providers for services and resources where it's cheaper, and then supplement with your own equipment when it's not.
 
 ## ***Disadvantages :-***
 
 - It can be more expensive than selecting one deployment model since it involves some CapEx cost up front.
 
 - It can be more complicated to set up and manage.

 # Community Cloud:

#### A community deployment model largely resembles a private one; the only difference is the set of users. While a private type implies that only one company owns the server, in the case of a community one, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources.
  
  ## ***The Strengths of a Community Cloud  :-***
- Cost reduction

- Improved security, privacy and reliability

- Ease of data sharing and collaboration

## ***The Shortcomings of a Community Cloud :-***

- High cost if compared to a public deployment model

- Sharing of fixed storage and bandwidth capacity

- It is not widespread so far

> # Cloud Deployment services:
  
***1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)***
  
***2. Platform as a service (PaaS)***
  
***3. Software as a service (SaaS)***
  
 #### When talking about cloud computing, there are three major categories. It's important to understand them because they are used in conversation, documentation, and training.

## 1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) :-

 - Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you the most control over the provided hardware that runs your application , storage, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
 
 **Examples: IBM, Google and Amazon Web Services.**

 ## 2. Platform as a service (PaaS) :-
 
 - PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates.

**Examples: Amazon Web Services and Rackspace.**

## 3. Software as a service (SaaS) :-

- SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS software.

**Examples: Google Applications and Salesforce.**
