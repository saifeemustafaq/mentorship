## Easy to use

**AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications – whether an existing
application or a new SaaS-based application. You can use the AWS Management Console or well-documented web services APIs to access AWS’s
application hosting platform.**


## Flexible

**AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need.
With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. This eases the
migration process for existing applications while preserving options for building new solutions.**

## Cost-Effective

**You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments. For
more information on comparing the costs of other hosting alternatives with AWS, see the AWS Economics Center.**

## Secure

**AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to secure and harden our infrastructure, including physical, operational, and software measures.
For more information, see the AWS Security Center.**


## Scalable and high-performance

**Using AWS tools, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, your application can scale up or down based on demand. Backed by Amazon’s
massive infrastructure, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.**


## Reliable

**With AWS, you take advantage of a scalable, reliable, and secure global computing infrastructure, the virtual backbone of Amazon.com’s
multi-billion dollar online business that has been honed for over a decade.**

# Cloud Computing and Virtualization :

![](https://www.techiexpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Figure1-Cloud-Architecture-and-its-layout-Pic-Credit.png)

- The technology that lies at the core of all cloud operations is virtualization.Virtualization lets you divide the hardware resources of a single physical server into smaller units. That physical server could therefore host multiple virtual machines running their own complete operating systems, each with its own memory, storage, and network
access.

- Virtualization’s flexibility makes it possible to provision a virtual server in a matter of seconds, run it for exactly the time your project requires, and then shut it down. The resources released will become instantly available to other workloads. The usage density you can achieve lets you squeeze the greatest value from your hardware and makes it easy to generate experimental and sandboxed environments.

---

# Cloud Computing Architecture :

- Major cloud providers like **AWS** have enormous server farms where hundreds of thousands of servers and data drives are maintained along with the network cabling necessary to connect them. A well-built virtualized environment could provide a virtual server using storage, memory, compute cycles, and network bandwidth collected from the most efficient mix of available sources it can find.

- A cloud computing platform offers on-demand, self-service access to pooled compute resources where your usage is metered and billed according to the volume you consume.Cloud computing systems allow for precise billing models, sometimes involving fractions ofa penny for an hour of consumption .

---

# AWS Platform Architecture :

AWS maintains data centers for its physical servers around the world. Because the centers are so widely distributed, you can reduce your own services’ network transfer latency by hosting your workloads geographically close to your users. It can also help you manage compliancewith regulations requiring you to keep data within a particular legal jurisdiction .
