 > # Scaling in cloud computing
 
###  Scaling is defined as the ability for an IT resource to handle growing or decreasing demands in a capable manner. It is one of the most popular and beneficial features of cloud computing, as businesses can scale up or down to meet demands based on season, projects, growth and more.
 
 ![](https://solutiondots.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Cloud-Scalability-and-Flexibility.jpg)
 
# Vertical scaling :

- #### Vertical is often thought of as the “easier” of the two methods. When scaling a system vertically, you add more power to an existing instance. This can mean more memory (RAM), faster storage such as Solid State Drives (SSDs), or more powerful processors (CPUs).

- #### The reason this is thought to be the easier option is that hardware is often trivial to upgrade on cloud platforms like AWS, where servers are already virtualized. There is also very little (if any) additional configuration you are required to do at the software level.

 ### Example 
 
 - #### To understand vertical scaling, envision a 20-story hotel. Within this hotel, there are countless rooms that guests constantly move in  and out of. There are often spaces available, as not all of the rooms are occupied at the same time. People can easily come and go  because there is space to accommodate them. As long as the capacity of this hotel is not exceeded, there is no issue. This is vertical   scaling.

- #### With computing,we can add or subtract resources, including memory or storage, within a server as long as the resources do not exceed  the capacity of the machine itself. Similar to the hotel example, resources can come and go easily and quickly, as long as there is room for them. Though it has limitations, this is a way to beef up your server and avoid latency and extra management.

# Horizontal scaling :

- #### Horizontal scaling refers to adding more servers to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling. This method tends to take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together, handle traffic efficiently and execute concurrent workloads.
 
## Example

#### Imagine a two-lane highway. Cars easily travel in each direction without huge traffic issues. But then the area surrounding the    highway is developed – new buildings are built and traffic increases. Pretty soon, this two-lane highway is clogged with cars, and accidents become commonplace. It’s clear that two-lanes are no longer enough. In order to avoid these issues, more lanes are added and an overpass is constructed. While this takes a significant amount of time, it solves the problem.
 
# Diagonal Scaling :
 
#### Diagonal Scaling allows you to experience the most efficient infrastructure scaling . When we combine vertical and horizontal, we simply grow within our existing server until you hit the capacity. Then, we can clone that server as necessary and continue the process, allowing us to deal with a lot of requests and traffic concurrently.
 
 
 ![](https://image4.slideserve.com/7684968/difference-between-horizontal-vertical-scaling-l.jpg)
 
# which scaling is better?

#### Horizontal scaling is often considered a long term advantage, whereas vertical scaling is usually considered a short term advantage.

#### The reason for this is that you can typically add as many servers as you need to your infrastructure, but at some point, hardware upgrades are just not plausible.

> # Benefits of cloud scalability:

## Scalability :

#### Scalability is the key concept for anyone in the DevOps world. Let’s briefly discuss the benefits of scalability.

## 1· Performance:

#### One core benefit of scalability in the cloud is that it facilitates performance. Scalable architecture has the ability to handle the bursts of traffic and heavy workloads that will come with business growth.

## 2· Cost-efficient:

#### You can allow your business to grow without making any expensive changes in the current setup. This reduces the cost implications of storage growth making scalability in the cloud very cost effective.

## 3. Easy and Quick:

#### Scaling up or scaling out in the cloud is simpler; you can commission additional VMs with a few clicks and after the payment is processed, the additional resources are available without any delay.

## 4· Capacity:

#### Scalability ensures that with the continuous growth of your business the storage space in cloud grows as well. Scalable cloud computing systems accommodate your data growth requirements. With scalability, you don’t have to worry about additional capacity needs.

## 5. Scalability admonition:

#### Scalability also has some limitations. If you want a fully scalable system then you have a large task to handle. It requires planning, testing and again testing for your data storage. If you have the applications already then splitting up the system will require code changes, updates and monitoring. You have to be well prepared for the digital transformation of your infrastructure.

> # AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud 

![](https://intellipaat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/differnce.jpg)


   | AWS | Microsoft Azure	| Google Cloud Platform |
   |:----|:----------------|:----------------------|
   | 12 years old | 7 years old | 6 years old |
   | Amazon S3 is mostly used for secondary backup | Backup is built into Azure | Does not provide any backup |
   | Gives managed virtual tape infrastructure across hybrid environments | Enterprise-grade hybrid cloud  storage | It relies on partners like Egnyte |
   | Dominant market position	| Second largest provider | Recently launched and new |
   | Pricing is per hour | Pricing is per minute | Pricing is per minute |
   

> # Microsoft Azure Features :


- ## Disaster Recovery : 

Since data is not stored on a single physical computer and instead it is present in different geographical locations, it will be much safer in the time of disasters. Even if one location undergoes some natural calamity, other locations are not harmed, and hence your data is safe.

- ## Security : 

Azure is continuously updated and that makes it secure. Security Development Lifecycle makes sure that every development phase is safe and secure.

- ## Flexibility : 

With Azure, you can scale your storage capacity. Recently, Azure even gave updates on its increased flexibility in terms of virtual machine size. These reserved instances can decrease the Cloud Computing cost.

- ## Cost : 

Using physical hardware for the deployment of applications comes up with emptying your pockets. Training people on how to work with it requires a lot of time and money. In this fast-paced technological world, there is huge competition. And if you take time in delivering the final product, it is obvious that your business will foresee a huge loss. Azure is the solution to all those problems as it is cheap in terms of hardware and manpower.


 # Azure Networking :
 

- **Azure Virtual Network:** It performs network isolation and segmentation with filters which routes the traffic. It comprises of Azure Connect which allows easy setup of IP-       based and Azure Traffic Manager.

- **Azure Load Balancer:** It balances a load of traffic going to virtual machines and isolates the external traffic to another virtual machine.

- **Azure Traffic Manager:** It provides load balancing features.

- **Azure Express Route:** It is a network that lets you extend the current network into Microsoft cloud over a private connection.

- **Azure DNS:** It translates a website to the IP address.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** It helps in improving delivering the content and allows the streaming of content by using the location of 24 different locations that are distributed throughout the world.

- **Azure VPN Gateway:** It sends encrypted traffic across a public connection.


 **Azure is a fast, flexible, and affordable platform, and its pricing and capabilities make it the best public cloud offering on the market. Now let’s take a look at how to put    it to work for user.**


## 1. . Enhance and Implement Backup and Disaster Recovery :

- Azure is a backup and disaster recovery dream tool. Because of its **flexibility, advanced site recovery**, and **built-in integration.**

- As a cloud-based solution, Azure is innately **flexible** – it can back up your data in almost any language, on any OS, and from any location. Plus, you define the frequency and extent of your backup schedule.

- Tape backup has a time and place, but it has limited abilities as a stand-alone backup and disaster recovery solution. Azure **site recovery** can enhance your tape backup with offsite replication, minimal onsite maintenance, up to ninety-nine years of data retention, **minimal or no capital investment**, and **minimal operational costs.** Azure backup stores three copies of your data in three different locations in the data center, and then another three copies in a remote Azure data center, so you never have to worry about losing data.

- If user in a Windows virtual environment, Azure’s **built-in integration** for additional backup will be a quick and painless solution. Azure site recovery integrates with System Center and HyperV architectures, creating a robust and seamless cohesion between Azure, System Center, and HyperV.


## 2. Host and Develop Web and Mobile Apps :

- Whether you’re looking for a platform for hosting, developing, or managing a web or mobile app, Azure makes those apps autonomous and adaptive with **patch management, AutoScale**, and **integration** for on-premise apps.

- With **Automatic patch management** for your virtual machines, you can spend less time managing your infrastructure and focus on improving your apps. Azure also comes with continuous deployment support, which allows you to streamline ongoing code updates.

- **AutoScale** is a feature built into Azure Web Apps that adjusts your resources automatically based on customer web traffic so you have the resources you need when traffic is high, and save money when you’re not in peak times.

- Through Azure, you can seamlessly **link your web app to an on-premise app.** Connecting apps in both locations lets both employees and partners securely access resources inside your firewall—resources that would otherwise be difficult to access externally.

## 3. Distribute and Supplement Active Directory :

- Azure can integrate with your Active Directory to supplement your identity and access capabilities—this gives your DNS a **global reach, centralized management**, and **robust security.**

- With Azure, you can **globally distribute** an Active Directory environment that is direct connect enabled. No other cloud provider has the ability to extend the reach of your domain controller and consolidate AD management like Azure.

- If you have multiple locations or use on-premise apps or cloud apps like Microsoft 365, Active Directory integration with Azure will be the **central tool for managing and maintaining access to all of these tools.**

- Azure also enables you to utilize multi-factor authentication, adding a new layer of **security** to your data and applications with zero hassle for your users. You can also easily implement single sign-on for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS cloud apps.

## 4.  Innovate with IoT Industry Solutions :

- The scalability, flexibility, and security of Microsoft Azure makes it the perfect resource for companies moving toward IoT solutions. You can connect your devices to the cloud using solutions that integrate with your existing infrastructure and start collecting new data about your company.

- Within the **Azure IoT Hub**, you can monitor and manage billions of devices and gain insights to help you make better business decisions, improve customer experiences, reduce complexity, lower costs, and speed up development.

- The enhanced security of Azure is a huge asset for IoT solutions, which traditionally have security gaps that hackers can take advantage of. Other benefits include remote monitoring and predictive maintenance and analytics.

- Getting started is easy with **Azure IoT solution accelerators**, preconfigured templates that are customizable to your needs.

# Identify the tasks of a data engineer in a cloud-hosted architecture :

- Data engineers who work on enterprise-level projects provide data to a variety of professionals, ranging from information workers to data scientists. Many organizations that pursue data-transformation projects still use traditional work roles such as business analysts. But as data types evolve and analytics methods change, new roles emerge.

- Suppose our organization is planning a digital-transformation project where data plays a key role. The organization will incorporate the best of their current systems, such as the online transaction processing (OLTP) and data warehousing systems. But the organization also wants to use predictive analytics to take advantage of sales opportunities and improve operational expenditures.

# Identify job roles


Large data projects can be complex. The projects often involve hundreds of decisions. Multiple people are typically involved, and each person helps take the project from design to production.

Roles such as business stakeholders, business analysts, and business intelligence developers are well known and still valuable. As data processing techniques change with technology, new roles are starting to appear. These roles provide specialized skills to help streamline the data engineering process.

 **Three roles are starting to become common in modern data projects:**

- Data engineer

- Data scientist

- Artificial intelligence (AI) engineer

# Data Engineer :

- The Azure data engineer focuses on data-related tasks in Azure. Primary responsibilities include using services and tools to ingest, egress, and transform data from multiple sources. Azure data engineers collaborate with business stakeholders to identify and meet data requirements. They design and implement solutions. They also manage, monitor, and ensure the security and privacy of data to satisfy business needs.

- The role of data engineer is different from the role of a database administrator. A data engineer's scope of work goes well beyond looking after a database and the server where it's hosted. Data engineers must also get, ingest, transform, validate, and clean up data to meet business requirements. This process is called data wrangling.

- A data engineer adds tremendous value to both business intelligence and data science projects. Data wrangling can consume a lot of time. When the data engineer wrangles data, projects move more quickly because data scientists can focus on their own areas of work.

- Both database administrators and business intelligence professionals can easily transition to a data engineer role. They just need to learn the tools and technology that are used to process large amounts of data.

---

# Data scientist :


- Data scientists perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. Their work can vary from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics. Descriptive analytics evaluate data through a process known as exploratory data analysis (EDA). Predictive analytics are used in machine learning to apply modeling techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns. These are an important part of forecast models.

- Descriptive and predictive analytics are just one aspect of data scientists' work. Some data scientists might even work in the realms of deep learning, iteratively experimenting to solve a complex data problem by using customized algorithms.

- Anecdotal evidence suggests that most of the work in a data science project is spent on data wrangling and feature engineering. Data scientists can speed up the experimentation process when data engineers use their skills to successfully wrangle data.

---

# AI engineer :

- AI engineers work with AI services such as Cognitive Services, Cognitive Search, and Bot Framework. Cognitive Services includes Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Bing Search, and Language Understanding (LUIS).

- Rather than creating models, AI engineers apply the prebuilt capabilities of Cognitive Services APIs. AI engineers embed these capabilities within a new or existing application or bot. AI engineers rely on the expertise of data engineers to store information that's generated from AI.

- For example, an AI engineer might be working on a Computer Vision application that processes images. This AI engineer would ask a data engineer to provision an Azure Cosmos DB instance to store the metadata and tags that the Computer Vision application generates.

----

## Role differences among Data engineer Data scientist and AI :


- Data engineers primarily provision data stores. They make sure that massive amounts of data are securely and cost-effectively extracted, loaded, and transformed.

- AI engineers add the intelligent capabilities of vision, voice, language, and knowledge to applications. To do this, they use the Cognitive Services offerings that are available out of the box.

- When a Cognitive Services application reaches its capacity, AI engineers call on data scientists. Data scientists develop machine learning models and customize components for an AI engineer's application.

- Each data-technology role is distinct, and each contributes an important part to digital transformation projects.

## Sandboxing  :

Sandboxing is a softwere managment strategy that isolates application from critical system resourses and other programs . It provides an extra layer of security that prevents malware or harmful applications from negatively affecting your system . 

##  Difference Between Cloud Computing and Fog Computing :

## cloud Computing: 

- The delivery of on-demand computing services is known as cloud computing. We can use applications to storage and processing power over the internet. It is a pay as you go service. Without owning any computing infrastructure or any data centers, anyone can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

- We can avoid the complexity of owning and maintaining infrastructure by using cloud computing services and pay for what we use.

- In turn, cloud computing services providers can benefit from significant economies of scale by delivering the same services to a wide range of customers.

## Fog Computing: 

- Fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure or process in which computing resources are located between the data source and the cloud or any other data center. Fog computing is a paradigm that provides services to user requests at the edge networks. 

- The devices at the fog layer usually perform operations related to networking such as routers, gateways, bridges, and hubs. Researchers envision these devices to be capable of performing both computational and networking operations, simultaneously. 

- Although these devices are resource-constrained compared to the cloud servers, the geological spread and the decentralized nature help in offering reliable services with coverage over a wide area. Fog computing is the physical location of the devices, which are much closer to the users than the cloud servers.

# Difference between Cloud Computing and Grid Computing :

## Cloud Computing:

Cloud Computing is a Client-server computing architecture. In cloud computing, resources are used in centralized pattern and cloud computing is a high accessible service. It is a pay and use business means, in cloud computing, the users pay for the use

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20190529121547/Untitled-Diagram-77.png)

## Grid Computing:

Grid Computing is a Distributed computing architecture. In grid computing, resources are used in collaborative pattern and also in grid computing, the users do not pay for use.
