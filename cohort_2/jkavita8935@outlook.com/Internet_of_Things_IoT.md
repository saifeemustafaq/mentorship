- Internet of Things(IoT) is a network of physical objects or people called "things" that are embedded with software, electronics, network, and sensors that allows these objects to collect and exchange data. The goal of IoT is to extend to internet connectivity from standard devices like computer, mobile, tablet to relatively dumb devices like a toaster.

- IoT makes virtually everything "smart," by improving aspects of our life with the power of data collection, AI algorithm, and networks. The thing in IoT can also be a person with a diabetes monitor implant, an animal with tracking devices, etc.

# How IOT works?

The entire IOT process starts with the devices themselves like smartphones, smartwatches, electronic appliances like TV, Washing Machine which helps you to communicate with the IOT platform.

**four fundamental components of an IoT system:**

## 1. Sensors/Devices: 

Sensors or devices are a key component that helps you to collect live data from the surrounding environment. All this data may have various levels of complexities. It could be a simple temperature monitoring sensor, or it may be in the form of the video feed.

A device may have various types of sensors which performs multiple tasks apart from sensing. Example, A mobile phone is a device which has multiple sensors like GPS, camera but your smartphone is not able to sense these things.

## 2. Connectivity:

All the collected data is sent to a cloud infrastructure. The sensors should be connected to the cloud using various mediums of communications. These communication mediums include mobile or satellite networks, Bluetooth, WI-FI, WAN, etc.

## 3. Data Processing: 

Once that data is collected, and it gets to the cloud, the software performs processing on the gathered data. This process can be just checking the temperature, reading on devices like AC or heaters. However, it can sometimes also be very complex like identifying objects, using computer vision on video.

## 4. User Interface: 

The information needs to be available to the end-user in some way which can be achieved by triggering alarms on their phones or sending them notification through email or text message. The user sometimes might need an interface which actively checks their IOT system. For example, the user has a camera installed in his home. He wants to access video recording and all the feeds with the help of a web server.

However, it's not always one-way communication. Depending on the IoT application and complexity of the system, the user may also be able to perform an action which may create cascading effects.

**For example**, if a user detects any changes in the temperature of the refrigerator, with the help of IOT technology the user should able to adjust the temperature with the help of their mobile phone.

## 1.Amazon Echo :

This is the voice controller it is a smart speaker that can respond to the voice commands (said by a human being) in IoT devices. This is done by using Alexa (it is an artificial intelligence personal assistant). We need to say things like play song, change the song, change room lights, research the internet, turn on the lights or adjust the doors, etc. We need to connect this device to Wi-Fi to use.

## 2. Goggle Home (Voice Controller) :

It will help us to make our day and life better. It is a Hi-Fi sound feature and a Mute option for security purposes. Suppose we want to know traffic on our route to office or market, we can add food lists, get reminders of our daily tasks or can ask what time meeting is scheduled, want to watch movies or tv shows, etc. All these questions are answered by the IoT devices. This device will manage our life and provide hand-free entertainment.

## 3. Nest Cam Indoor :

Everyone wants to secure home from this is the approach for it. Suppose if you go on a business trip for some days and want to observe your home from any location you can do that with this device. We will get the alert message over the phone if something bad happens like window breaks or sound. We can not watch the video every second. The device will record it and if we miss alert then it will send notification and photos of the activity. Have security at home for a home away. We can install it anywhere in the home-like wall, windows.

## 4.Nest Thermostat :

It will adjust the home temperature as per your like and build it around it will save energy and alert user if the temperature is dangerous to belongings. This will help the user to save heating and cooling bills. Suppose if you are at the office then the thermostat will sense it by using sensors and will check phone location if you are not at home and will set itself, save energy. The device will automatically adapt user life and season, just keep for one week and will program itself.

## 5. Smart Band (Activity Tracker) :

User needs to connect the band to the phone via it will track the number of steps youâ€™ve walked, calories burned, measure heart rate, count sleeping hours, fitness tracking. We can see messages on the band and control it. Change music via the band.
