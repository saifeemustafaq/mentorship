# What are Service-Level Agreements ?

##### Ans. 

- A service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user.

- The most common component of an SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract.

- The agreement may involve separate organizations, or different teams within one organization. Contracts between the service provider and other third parties are often (incorrectly) called SLAs – because the level of service has been set by the (principal) customer, there can be no "agreement" between third parties; these agreements are simply "contracts.

- SLAs commonly include many components, from a definition of services to the termination of agreement.

- SLAs are so widely used these days that larger organizations have many different SLAs existing within the company itself.

- Two different units in an organization script a SLA with one unit being the customer and another being the service provider.

- This practice helps to maintain the same quality of service amongst different units in the organization and also across multiple locations of the organization.

- This internal scripting of SLA also helps to compare the quality of service between an in-house department and an external service provider.

# Components of Service-Level Agreements :

A well defined and typical SLA will contain the following components

### 1.Type of service to be provided :
It specifies the type of service and any additional details of type of service to be provided.

### 2.The service's desired performance level, especially its reliability and responsiveness :
A reliable service will be the one which suffers minimum disruptions in a specific amount of time and is available at almost all times.

### 3.Monitoring process and service level reporting :
This component describes how the performance levels are supervised and monitored.

### 4.The steps for reporting issues with the service :
This component will specify the contact details to report the problem to and the order in which details about the issue have to be reported.

### 5.Response and issue resolution time-frame :
Response time-frame is the time period by which the service provider will start the investigation of the issue.

### 6.Repercussions for service provider not meeting its commitment :
If the provider is not able to meet the requirements as stated in SLA then service provider will have to face consequences for the same.

# Service Level Agreement Types :

Because service level agreements have many applications, they have been divided into categories. Thus, we have:

### 1.Customer-based SLA :
An agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use. For example, an SLA between a supplier (IT service provider) and the finance department of a large organization for the services such as finance system, payroll system, billing system, procurement/purchase system, etc.

### 2.Service-based SLA :

- An agreement for all customers using the services being delivered by the service provider. For example:

- A mobile service provider offers a routine service to all the customers and offers certain maintenance as a part of an offer with the universal charging.

- An email system for the entire organization. There are chances of difficulties arising in this type of SLA as level of the services being offered may vary for different customers (for example, head office staff may use high-speed LAN connections while local offices may have to use a lower speed leased line).

### 3.Multilevel SLA :

- The SLA is split into the different levels, each addressing different set of customers for the same services, in the same SLA.

- ##### Corporate-level SLA :
Covering all the generic service level management (often abbreviated as SLM) issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization. These issues are likely to be less volatile and so updates (SLA reviews) are less frequently required.

- ##### Customer-level SLA :
covering all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group, regardless of the services being used.

- ##### Service-level SLA :
covering all SLM issue relevant to the specific services, in relation to this specific customer group.

# What is scaling in cloud computing?

##### Ans.

- Scaling is defined as the ability for an IT resource to handle growing or decreasing demands in a capable manner.

- Scalability is the ability to easily add or subtract compute or storage resources.

- It is one of the most popular and beneficial features of cloud computing, as businesses can scale up or down to meet demands based on season, projects, growth and more.

- By implementing cloud scalability, you enable your resources to grow as your traffic or organization grows, and vice versa.

- There are a few main ways to scale in the cloud:

## 1.Vertical Scaling :

- To understand vertical scaling, envision a 20-story hotel. Within this hotel, there are countless rooms that guests constantly move in and out of.

- There are often spaces available, as not all of the rooms are occupied at the same time. People can easily come and go because there is space to accommodate them.

-  As long as the capacity of this hotel is not exceeded, there is no issue. This is vertical scaling.

- With computing, you can add or subtract resources, including memory or storage, within a server as long as the resources do not exceed the capacity of the machine itself.

- Similar to the hotel example, resources can come and go easily and quickly, as long as there is room for them. Though it has limitations, this is a way to beef up your server and avoid latency and extra management.

## 2.Horizontal Scaling :

- Horizontal scaling is a bit different. This time, imagine a two-lane highway. Cars easily travel in each direction without huge traffic issues. But then the area surrounding the highway is developed – new buildings are built and traffic increases.

- Pretty soon, this two-lane highway is clogged with cars, and accidents become commonplace. It’s clear that two-lanes are no longer enough.

- In order to avoid these issues, more lanes are added and an overpass is constructed. While this takes a significant amount of time, it solves the problem.

- Horizontal scaling refers to adding more servers to your network, rather than simply adding resources like with vertical scaling.

- This method tends to take more time and is more complex, but it allows you to connect servers together, handle traffic efficiently and execute concurrent workloads.

## 3.Diagonal Scaling :

- So what happens if you combine the two scaling methods? Well, you get diagonal scaling, which allows you to experience the most efficient infrastructure scaling.

- When you combine vertical and horizontal, you simply grow within your existing server until you hit the capacity.

- Then, you can clone that server as necessary and continue the process, allowing you to deal with a lot of requests and traffic concurrently.

# What is a Container ?

##### Ans.

![](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/containers-in-cloud-computing.png)

- A Container in cloud computing is an approach to operating system virtualization. By this, the user can work with a program and its dependencies using resource procedures that are isolated.

- The code of the application can be bundled with configurations and dependencies in a systematic manner.

- Container in cloud computing is used to build blocks, which help in producing operational efficiency, version control, developer productivity and environmental consistency.Because of this, the user is assured of reliability, consistency, and quickness regardless of the distributed platform.

- The infrastructure is enhanced since it provides more control over the granular activities on resources.

- The container usage in online services benefits storage with cloud computing information security, availability and elasticity.

## Advantages of a Container in Cloud Computing :

#### The Consistency in Cloud Storage :
The container enhances portability. It eliminates the organizational and technical frictions so that the program moves through the entire process cycle.

#### Application Version Control :
Through container in cloud computing, the users can look on the current version of the application code as well as their dependencies.

#### Efficiency in the Operational Activities :
The users can achieve more resources through the container in cloud computing. By this, the users can also work at a time on several applications.

#### Productivity of the Developers :
The containers deduct the dependencies and conflicts between the cross-service and thus the productivity increases. The component of the program is segregated into different entities that run a separate micro-service.
