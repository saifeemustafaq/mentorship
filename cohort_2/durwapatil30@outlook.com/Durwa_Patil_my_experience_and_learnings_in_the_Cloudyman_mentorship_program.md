Today the speaker explained us the purpose of learning cloud computing  

# Cloud Computing :

#### Ans.

##### cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

Cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. 

Here are seven common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services:
- cost  
- speed  
- global scale  
- productivity  
- performance  
- reliability  
- security  

# Types of cloud computing  

Not all clouds are the same and not ontype of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.

First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud.

# What does a virtual machine mean ?

##### Ans.

- A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.

- In other words, a VM is a software application that performs most functions of a physical computer, actually behaving as a separate computer system.

- A virtual machine, usually known as a guest, is created within another computing environment referred as a "host." Multiple virtual machines can exist within a single host at one time.

# Benefits of cloud computing

### Increased collaboration

Collaboration in a cloud environment gives your business the ability to communicate and share more easily outside of the traditional methods. If you are working on a project across different locations, you could use cloud computing to give employees, contractors and third parties access to the same files. You could also choose a cloud computing model that makes it easy for you to share your records with your advisers (e.g. a quick and secure way to share accounting records with your accountant or financial adviser).

### Flexibility

Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices. For example, you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection). If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily.

### Automatic software updates

Access to automatic updates for your IT requirements may be included in your service fee. Depending on your cloud computing service provider, your system will regularly be updated with the latest technology. This could include up-to-date versions of software, as well as upgrades to servers and computer processing power.

### Cost savings

Moving to cloud computing may reduce the cost of managing and maintaining your IT systems. Rather than purchasing expensive systems and equipment for your business, you can reduce your costs by using the resources of your cloud computing service provider. You may be able to reduce your operating costs because:

- the cost of system upgrades, new hardware and software may be included in your contract
- you no longer need to pay wages for expert staff
- your energy consumption costs may be reduced
- there are fewer time delays.

Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.

## Microsoft Azure Has Following Qualities:

- It can deliver and innovate high-quality apps.
- It can support all major mobile platforms and can provide cross-device experience as well.
- The user can use and run any stack on either Windows or Linux based and can even use advanced capabilities such as Azure Container Service or Kubernetes cluster.

## Microsoft provides five different customer support options for Azure:

- Basic
- Developer
- Standard
- Professional Direct
- Premier

## How does Windows Azure work?

##### Ans.

Here in Azure, the operating system which is behind this technology is called Microsoft Azure, which helps in running its fabric layer (a cluster hosted in Microsoft data centers and it is responsible to manage storage and computing process of various applications). Here, Microsoft Fabric controller controls the scalability and reliability features and helps in avoiding the service crash and managing web apps.

### Windows Azure component is responsible to run applications and store data. It contains the following listed five services:
- Processor Compute
- Storage
- Virtual Network
- CDN
- Fabric Controller

## Benefits of Azure

Microsoft Azure has provided a platform to the developers through which they can create and deploy an application compatible with many platforms. It lets the organizations perform large-scale computing and perform predictive analysis.

Users can also leverage IoT services through the Azure platform. Azure applications can be operated in the global network. It provides the following benefits:

- Free start and scale as per your need
- Infrastructure as per need
- Cloud platform of enterprise level
- Valuable data insights
- Encode, Protect, Stream and Ingesting facility for applications

Above listed benefits are not limited even there are many organizational benefits offered by Azure. The organizations can leverage the benefits and optimize their performance.
