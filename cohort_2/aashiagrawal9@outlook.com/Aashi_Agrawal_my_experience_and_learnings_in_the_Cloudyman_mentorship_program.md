# 1. Introduction to cloud Computing: 

   Cloud computing consists of three distinct types of computing services delivered remotely to clients via the internet. Clients typically pay a monthly or annual service fee to providers, to gain access to systems that deliver software as a service, platforms as a service and infrastructure as a service to subscribers. Clients who subscribe to cloud computing services can reap a variety of benefits, depending on their particular business needs at a given point in time. The days of large capital investments in software and IT infrastructure are now a thing of the past for any enterprise that chooses to adopt the cloud computing model for procurement of IT services. 

 The ability to access powerful IT resources on an incremental basis is leveling the playing field for small and medium sized organizations, providing them with the necessary tools and technology to compete in the global marketplace, without the previously requisite investment in on premise IT resources. Clients who subscribe to computing services delivered via the “cloud”? are able to greatly reduce the IT service expenditures for their organizations; and gain access to more agile and flexible enterprise level computing services, in the process.  
 
 # 2. How cloud works: 
 
 To understand the workings of a cloud system, it is easier to divide it into two sections: the front end and the back end. They are connected to each other through a network, usually the Internet. The front end is the side of the computer user or client. The back end is ‘the cloud’ section of the system. 
 The front end consists of the client’s computer or computer network. Also the application essential to access the cloud computing system. It is not necessary that all cloud computing systems have the same user interface. 
 On the back end of the cloud technology system, there are various computers, servers and data storage systems that make up the cloud. A cloud computing system could potentially include any computer program, from data processing to video games. Generally, each application will have its own dedicated server.  
 
 # 3. Benefits of Cloud Computing: 
 
 #### **1. Reduced IT costs:**
 - The cost of system upgrades, new hardware and software may be included in your contract.
 - you no longer need to pay wages for expert staff.  
 #### **2. Scalability:**  
 - Your business can scale up or scale down your operation and storage needs quickly to suit your situation, allowing flexibility as your needs change. 
 - Using the cloud frees up your time so you can get on with running your business. 
 #### **3. Business continuity:** 
 - Protecting your data and systems is an important part of business continuity planning. 
 - Whether you experience a natural disaster, power failure or other crisis, having your data stored in the cloud ensures it is backed up and protected in a secure and safe location. 
 #### **4. Flexibility of work practices:** 
 - Cloud computing allows employees to be more flexible in their work practices. For example, you have the ability to access data from home, on holiday, or via the commute to and from work (providing you have an internet connection). 
 - If you need access to your data while you are off-site, you can connect to your virtual office, quickly and easily.  
 
 # 4. Applications of cloud computing: 
 
 - **Online File storage:** 
 MediaFire, megaupload, hotfile, 4Shared, rapidshare, yourfilehost are such examples which are used to host files including documents, images, presentation, videos, etc. The interface is easy to use, and users can upload and download files from these sites.  
 - **Photo editing software:** 
 Picnik, Pixlr, etc. are popular free online photo editing software. This online software has features such as cropping of the image, resizing, rotation based on degrees, special effects, addition and editing features are also included in a GUI (Graphical User Interface) format.  
 - **E-commerce software:** 
 Cloud based e-application allows users and e-business to respond quickly to market opportunities & challenges the modern e-commerce is facing. It became for business tycoons to focus on the usage of cloud computing without considering the time and effort involved in implementing a reliable solution.  
 - **Miscellaneous application:** 
 One of the 1st utilization of free SaaS applications is to check for the status of packages & items. Applications such as UPS, FedEx, US Postal Service, etc. provide free tracking of packages online. Another application name - XE provides services online from foreign exchange tools.  
 - **Presentation software:** 
 Sliderocket is an online free application to create a presentation. It allows importing of Microsoft's PowerPoint presentations. Since it is a web-based cloud application, the presentations can be accessed from anywhere within the globe.  
 - **Word processing application:** 
 Writeboard is another online word processing and document editing application. It has a unique feature that multiple users can access the same document using this application, edit that document and save the document after editing, but the document will have different versions. But it doesn't allow importing the word files.

 >> 1. Introduction To Github 
 >> 2. How Github Works 
 >> 3. What's a repository? 
 >> 4. The Github Flow  
 
 # 1. Introduction to Github: 
 GitHub is a Git hosting repository that provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. With collaboration layers like the GitHub flow, a community of 15 million developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, GitHub changes the way software is built.  
 
 GitHub for $7.5 billion in June, 2018. GitHub, which is delivered through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, was started in 2008 and was founded on Git, an open source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers.GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans.  
 
 # 2. How Github Works: 
 GitHub builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories, where developers can outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then, using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.  
 
 # 3. What's a repository? 
 A repository, or Git project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits, and the commits exist as a linked-list relationship, and can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a git repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.  
 
 Working in repositories keeps development projects organized and protected. Developers are encouraged to fix bugs, or create fresh features, without fear of derailing mainline development efforts. Git facilitates this through the use of topic branches: lightweight pointers to commits in history that can be easily created and deprecated when no longer needed.Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help teams work together to build the best possible final product.  
 
# 4. The Github Flow: 
The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours. 
The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:  

> ## Create a branch:  
>Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually master) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.  

> ## Add commits: 
> Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.  

> ## Open a pull request: 
>Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.  

> ## Discuss and review code: 
>Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.  

> ## Merge: 
>Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.  

> ## Deploy: 
> Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.

>> 1. Virtual Machine 
>> 2. How VM works 
>> 3. Importance of virtual machine 
>>  - Advantages 
>>  - Disadavantages  

# 1. Virtual Machine:  
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). Software called a hypervisor separates the machine’s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM. The physical machines, equipped with a hypervisor such as Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), is called the host machine, host computer, host operating system, or simply host. The many VMs that use its resources are guest machines, guest computers, guest operating systems, or simply guests. The hypervisor treats compute resources—like CPU, memory, and storage—as a pool of resources that can easily be relocated between existing guests or to new virtual machines.  

VMs are isolated from the rest of the system, and multiple VMs can exist on a single piece of hardware, like a server. They can be moved between host servers depending on demand or to use resources more efficiently.
VMs allow multiple different operating systems to run simultaneously on a single computer—like a Linux® distro on a MacOS laptop. Each operating system runs in the same way an operating system or application normally would on the host hardware, so the end user experience emulated within the VM is nearly identical to a real-time operating system experience running on a physical machine.  

# 2. How VM works:  
Virtualization Technology allows you to share a system with many virtual environments. The hypervisor manages the hardware and separates the physical resources from the virtual environments. Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the VMs.
When the VM is running and a user or program issues an instruction that requires additional resources from the physical environment, the hypervisor schedules the request to the physical system’s resources so that the virtual machine’s operating system and applications can access the shared pool of physical resources.  

Server consolidation is a top reason to use VMs. Most operating system and application deployments only use a small amount of the physical resources available when deployed to bare metal. By virtualizing your servers, you can place many virtual servers onto each physical server to improve hardware utilization. 
This keeps you from needing to purchase additional physical resources, like hard drives or hard disks, as well as reducing the need for power, space, and cooling in the datacenter. VMs provide additional disaster recovery options by enabling failover and redundancy that could previously only be achieved through additional hardware.  

A VM provides an environment that is isolated from the rest of a system, so whatever is running inside a VM won’t interfere with anything else running on the host hardware.
Because VMs are isolated, they are a good option for testing new applications or setting up a production environment. You can also run a single purpose VM to support a specific process.  

# 3. Importance of Virtual Machine: 
Virtual machines, or VMs, have become integral parts of business-oriented computing. A virtual machine acts as an emulator of a computer, executing programs like one.
In summary, it is a piece of software that allows you to run operating systems within. It can give a company adaptability, in that, any networking configurations or installed applications will be set up separately from the host computer, but rather will dwell in the software.  
While there are many progressive advantages to implementing virtual machines, there are also some disadvantages:  

## Advantages: 
- Can use multiple operating system environments on the same computer. 
- Virtual machines can provide an instruction set architecture, or ISA, structure different than the actual computer. The ISA serves as the interface between software and hardware. 
- When you create your virtual machine, you create a virtual hard disk. So, everything on that machine can crash, but if it does, it won’t affect the host machine. 
- There are security benefits to running virtual machines. For example, if you need to run an application of questionable security, you can run it in a guest operating system. So, if the application causes damage, then it will be only temporary after the guest is shut down 
- Virtual machines also allow for better security forensics by monitoring guest operating systems for deficiencies and allowing the user to quarantine it for analysis.  

## Disadvantage: 
- Virtual machines are less efficient than real machines because they access the hardware indirectly. Running software on top of the host operating system means that it will have to request access to the hardware from the host. That will slow the usability. 
- When several virtual machines are running on the same host, performance may be hindered if the computer it’s running on lacks sufficient power. 
- A virtual machine can be infected with the weaknesses of the host machine. As an example, process isolation is a feature usually employed by operating systems. However, there are bugs that violate it. 
- A regular computer devoid of virtual machines would then only be affected. But, a computer with a number of virtual machines would then infect each of those “machines” as well.

>> 1. Introduction to AWS 
>> 2. Amazon Web Services Cloud Platform  

# 1. Introduction to AWS: 
Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. From data warehousing to deployment tools, directories to content delivery, over 140 AWS services are available. New services can be provisioned quickly, without the upfront capital expense. This allows enterprises, start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, and customers in the public sector to access the building blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirements.  

In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web services—now commonly known as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace upfront capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business. With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.  

Today, AWS provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of businesses in 190 countries around the world.  

# 2. Amazon Web Services Cloud Platform: 
More than 100 services comprise the Amazon Web Services portfolio, including those for compute, databases, infrastructure management, application development and security. These services, by category, include:  

### 1. Availability: 
- Amazon Web Services provides services from dozens of data centers spread across availability zones (AZs) in regions across the world. An AZ is a location that contains multiple physical data centers.  
- A business will choose one or multiple availability zones for a variety of reasons, such as compliance and proximity to end customers. For example, an AWS customer can spin up virtual machines (VMs) and replicate data in different AZs to achieve a highly reliable infrastructure that is resistant to failures of individual servers or an entire data center.  

### 2. Storage: 
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides scalable object storage for data backup, collection and analytics. An IT professional stores data and files as S3 objects -- which can range up to 5 gigabytes (GB) -- inside S3 buckets to keep them organized. A business can save money with S3 through its Infrequent Access storage tier or by using Amazon Glacier for long-term cold storage.  
- A business can also migrate data to the cloud via storage transport devices, such as AWS Snowball and Snowmobile, or use AWS Storage Gateway to enable on-premises apps to access cloud data.  

### 3. Databases, data management: 
- he Amazon Relational Database Service -- which includes options for Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB and a proprietary high-performance database called Amazon Aurora -- provides a relational database management system for AWS users. AWS also offers managed NoSQL databases through Amazon DynamoDB.  
- An AWS customer can use Amazon ElastiCache and DynamoDB Accelerator as in-memory and real-time data caches for applications. Amazon Redshift offers a data warehouse, which makes it easier for data analysts to perform business intelligence (BI) tasks.  

### 4. Migration, hybrid cloud: 
- AWS includes various tools and services designed to help users migrate applications, databases, servers and data onto its public cloud. The AWS Migration Hub provides a location to monitor and manage migrations from on premises to the cloud.  
- Amazon also has partnerships with several technology vendors that ease hybrid cloud deployments. VMware Cloud on AWS brings software-defined data center technology from VMware to the AWS cloud. Red Hat Enterprise Linux for Amazon EC2 is the product of another partnership, extending Red Hat's operating system to the AWS cloud.  

### 5. Networking: 
- An Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) gives an administrator control over a virtual network to use an isolated section of the AWS cloud. AWS automatically provisions new resources within a VPC for extra protection.  
- Admins can balance network traffic with the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service, which includes the Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer. AWS also provides a domain name system called Amazon Route 53 that routes end users to applications.

>> 1. Types of Cloud
>> - On the basis of location 
>> - On the basis of service  
>> 2. Introduction to Green Cloud Computing 
>> 3. Advantages and disadvantages of Green Cloud  

# 1. Types of cloud:  
To be precise, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storages and more over the Internet. The companies that offer these computing services are called cloud providers. They charge for cloud computing services based on usage.  
Cloud computing is usually classified on the basis of location, or on the service that the cloud is offering.  

### On the basis of location:  
- Public Cloud:  
Whole computing infrastructure is located on the premises of a cloud computing company that offers the cloud service.The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage or bandwidth they consume.
 Public clouds can also be deployed faster than on-premises infrastructures and with an almost infinitely scalable platform. Every employee of a company can use the same application from any office or branch using their device of choice as long as they can access the Internet. While security concerns have been raised over public cloud environments, when implemented correctly, the public cloud can be as secure as the most effectively managed private cloud implementation if the provider uses proper security methods, such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS).  
 
 - Private Cloud:  
 Hosting all your computing infrastructure yourself and is not shared. The security and control level is highest while using a private network.The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users instead of the general public. Also called an internal or corporate cloud, private cloud computing gives businesses many of the benefits of a public cloud - including self-service, scalability and elasticity - with the additional control and customisation available from dedicated resources over a computing infrastructure hosted on-premises.
Two models for cloud services can be delivered in a private cloud. The first is infrastructure as a service (IaaS) which allows a company to use infrastructure resources such as compute, network and storage as a service. The second is platform as a service (PaaS) which lets a company deliver everything from simple cloud-based applications to sophisticated-enabled enterprise applications.
 
 - Hybrid Cloud:  
 Using both private and public clouds, depending on their purpose. You host your most important applications on your own servers to keep them more secure and secondary applications elsewhere.A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. When computing and processing demand fluctuates, hybrid cloud computing gives businesses the ability to seamlessly scale their on-premises infrastructure up to the public cloud to handle any overflow—without giving third-party datacenters access to the entirety of their data. 
Using a hybrid cloud not only allows companies to scale computing resources, it also eliminates the need to make massive capital expenditures to handle short-term spikes in demand as well as when the business needs to free up local resources for more sensitive data or applications. Companies will pay only for resources they temporarily use instead of having to purchase, program, and maintain additional resources and equipment that could remain idle over long periods of time.  
 
 - Community Cloud:  
 A community cloud is shared between organizations with a common goal or that fit into a specific community (professional community, geographic community, etc.).A community cloud in computing is a collaborative effort in which infrastructure is shared between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externally. This is controlled and used by a group of organizations that have shared interest. The costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized.  
 
### On the basis of service:  
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure-as-a-Service):  
IaaS is the most basic category of cloud computing services that allows you rent IT infrastructure (servers or VM’s) from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet. It’s one of the four types of cloud services, along with software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and serverless.  
IaaS quickly scales up and down with demand, letting you pay only for what you use. It helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it.

- **PaaS**(Platform-as-a-Service):  
Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) refers to the supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. It is designed to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.  
Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. 
Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure—servers, storage and networking—but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems and more. PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing and updating.  

- **SaaS**(Software-as-a-Service):  
Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet as per the demand and on a subscription basis. SaaS helps you host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance (software upgrades and security patching).
Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are email, calendaring and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).
SaaS provides a complete software solution which you purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis from a cloud service provider. You rent the use of an app for your organisation and your users connect to it over the Internet, usually with a web browser. All of the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software and app data are located in the service provider’s data center.  

# 2. Introduction to Green Cloud Computing:  
Green cloud is a buzzword that refers to the potential environmental benefits that information technology (IT) services delivered over the Internet can offer society. The term combines the words green -- meaning environmentally friendly -- and cloud, the traditional symbol for the Internet and the shortened name for a type of service delivery model known as cloud computing.
Because so much of a data center’s energy expenditures support data storage, the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) has promoted new technologies and architectures to help save energy. Advances in SAS drive technologies, automated data deduplication, storage virtualization and storage convergence reduce the amount of physical storage a data center requires, which helps decrease its carbon footprint and lower operating expenditures (OPEX) and capital expenditures (CAPEX).  

Because the color green is also associated with paper money, the label green cloud is sometimes used to describe the cost-efficiency of a cloud computing initiative.Green computing refers to the eco-friendly and environmentally responsible usage of computers and their resources associated with the IT industry and services. In other words, it involves the designing, engineering, and usage of computing devices in such a way that it can reduce any adverse impact on the environmental impact in the IT industry. Green means environment-friendly while the cloud is the representative of the internet service delivery model.  

# 3. Advantages and Disadvantages of Green cloud:  
### Advantages:  
- Reduced energy usage from green computing techniques translates into lower carbon dioxide emissions, stemming from a reduction in the fossil fuel used in power plants and transportation.  
- Conserving resources means less energy is required to produce, use, and dispose of products.  
- Saving energy and resources saves money.  
- Green computing even includes changing government policy to encourage recycling and lowering energy use by individuals and businesses. 
- Reduce the risk existing in the laptops such as chemical known to cause cancer, nerve damage and immune reactions in humans.  

### Disadvantages:  
- Rapid technology change.  
- Some computers that are green may be considerably underpowered.  
- Green computing could actually be quite costly.
