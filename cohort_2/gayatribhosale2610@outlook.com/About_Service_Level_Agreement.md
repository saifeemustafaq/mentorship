# What is Service Level Agreement?

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is the bond for performance negotiated between the cloud services provider and the client. Earlier, 
in cloud computing all Service Level Agreements were negotiated between a client and the service consumer. Nowadays, with the
initiation of large utility-like cloud computing providers, most Service Level Agreements are standardized until a client becomes a
large consumer of cloud services. 

#### Service level agreements are also defined at different levels which are mentioned below:

* Customer-based SLA
* Service-based SLA
* Multilevel SLA

Few Service Level Agreements are enforceable as contracts, but mostly are agreements or contracts which are more along the lines of 
an Operating Level Agreement (OLA) and may not have the restriction of law. It is fine to have an attorney review the documents
before making a major agreement to the cloud service provider. 

#### Service Level Agreements usually specify some parameters which are mentioned below:

1. Availability of the Service (uptime)
2. Latency or the response time
3. Service components reliability
4. Each party accountability
5. Warranties

In any case, if a cloud service provider fails to meet the stated targets of minimums then the provider has to pay the penalty to 
the cloud service consumer as per the agreement. So, Service Level Agreements are like insurance policies in which the corporation
has to pay as per the agreements if any casualty occurs.
Microsoft publishes the Service Level Agreements linked with the Windows Azure Platform components, which is demonstrative of
industry practice for cloud service vendors. Each individual component has its own Service Level Agreements.

#### Below are two major Service Level Agreements (SLA) described:

## 1. Windows Azure SLA –

Window Azure has different SLA’s for compute and storage. For compute, there is a guarantee that when a client deploys two or more
role instances in separate fault and upgrade domains, client’s internet facing roles will have external connectivity minimum 99.95% 
of the time. Moreover, all of the role instances of the client are monitored and there is guarantee of detection 99.9% of the time
when a role instance’s process is not runs and initiates properly.

## 2. SQL Azure SLA –

SQL Azure clients will have connectivity between the database and internet gateway of SQL Azure. SQL Azure will handle a “Monthly
Availability” of 99.9% within a month. Monthly Availability Proportion for a particular tenant database is the ratio of the time 
the database was available to customers to the total time in a month. Time is measured in some intervals of minutes in a 30-day 
monthly cycle. Availability is always remunerated for a complete month. A portion of time is marked as unavailable if the customer’s
attempts to connect to a database are denied by the SQL Azure gateway.


Service Level Agreements are based on the usage model. Frequently, cloud providers charge their pay-as-per-use resources at a premium 
and deploy standards Service Level Agreements only for that purpose. Clients can also subscribe at different levels that guarantees
access to a particular amount of purchased resources. The Service Level Agreements (SLAs) attached to a subscription many times offer
various terms and conditions. If client requires access to a particular level of resources, then the client need to subscribe to a 
service. A usage model may not deliver that level of access under peak load condition.

## Benefits of the SLA

- Protects both parties. When internal IT deploys a new application, they work closely with end users to make sure everything isworking.
They track application success by emails and phone calls, and if there is a problem they get on the phone with the vendor to solve it. 
However, it doesn’t work like that with a business customer and their cloud provider. An SLA details expectations and reporting, so the
customer knows exactly what to expect and what everyone’s responsibilities are.

- Guarantees service level objectives. The cloud provider agrees to the customer’s SLOs and can prove it reached them. If there is a 
problem, then there is a clear response and solution mechanism. This also protects the provider. If a customer saved money by agreeing 
to a 48-hour data recovery window for some of their applications, then the provider is entirely within its rights if it takes 47 hours.

- Quality of service. The customer does not have to guess or assume levels of service. They get frequent reports on the metrics that are
meaningful to them. And if the cloud computing provider fails an agreement, then the customer has recourse via negotiated penalties.
Although these penalties will not necessarily replace lost revenue, they can be excellent motivators when the cloud computing provider
is paying $3,000 a day while a service is down.

# What is Uptime? 

Uptime simply means the duration for which any equipment or system will remain active or function properly. Similarly, in the cloud hosting services, by uptime we mean the time for which you will be able to access Cloud network system or you will be able to get advantages of cloud service.

Different cloud hosting service providers offer different Cloud Uptime. Suppose a cloud service provider offers 99.5% Cloud Uptime. This means that the cloud server will function well for the complete year, except 1.83 days. However, Cloud Uptime promise does not include server maintenance time and scheduled outage.

# What is Downtime (cloud service)?

Downtime is a period of time in which the service is unavailable or not working due to unexpected circumstances such as outages, maintenance activities or updating periods.

With the advent of virtualization and cloud computing services, a consistent and all-round service is a necessity. Customers who are looking for cloud services would only be convinced if the cloud solution is promised to perform better instead of an on-premise solution. Downtime or availability is considered to be one of the most important factors to consider when implementing a new cloud service to the solution lineup.
