## What is IOT?

The Internet of things ( IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, 
and connectivity which enables these things to connect, collect and exchange data.

## IoT applications

The ability of IoT provide sensor information as well as enable device-to-device communication is driving a broad set of applications. The following are some of the most popular applications and what they do.

- **1. Create new efficiencies in manufacturing through machine monitoring and product-quality monitoring-** Machines can be continuously monitored and analyzed to make sure they are performing within required tolerances. Products can also be monitored in real time to identify and address quality defects.

- **2. Improve the tracking and "ring-fencing" of physical assets-** Tracking enables businesses to quickly determine asset location. Ring-fencing allows them to make sure that high-value assets are protected from theft and removal.

- **3. Use wearables to monitor human health analytics and environmental conditions-** IoT wearables enable people to better understand their own health and allow physicians to remotely monitor patients. This technology also enables companies to track the health and safety of their employees, which is especially useful for workers employed in hazardous conditions.

- **4. Drive efficiencies and new possibilities in existing processes-** One example of this is the use of IoT to increase efficiency and safety in fleet management. Companies can use IoT fleet monitoring to direct trucks, in real time, to improve efficiency.

- **5. Enable business process changes-** An example of this is the use of IoT devices to monitor the health of remote machines and trigger service calls for preventive maintenance. The ability to remotely monitor machines is also enabling new product-as-a-service business models, where customers no longer need to buy a product but instead pay for its usage.
