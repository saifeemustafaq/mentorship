## What is IOT?

The Internet of things ( IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, 
and connectivity which enables these things to connect, collect and exchange data.

## Major components of Internet of Things

### 1. Things or Devices

- Things or Devices are the primary physical objects that are being monitored. Smart sensors attached to these devices are continuously collecting data from the device and transmitting it to next layer i.e. gateway.
- Latest advancements in the semiconductor technology can produce micro smart sensors for various applications.

### 2. User Interface

- User interfaces are the visible, tangible part of the IoT system which can be accessible by users. Designers will have to make sure a well-designed user interface for minimum effort for users and encourage more interactions.

### 3. Cloud

- Internet of things creates massive data from devices, applications and users which must be managed in an efficient way. IoT cloud offers tools to collect, process, manage and store huge amount of data in real time. Industries and services can easily access these data remotely and make critical decisions when necessary.
- Basically, IoT cloud is a sophisticated high-performance network of servers optimized to perform high-speed data processing of myriads of devices, traffic management and deliver accurate data analysis. Distributed management database systems are one of the indispensable components of IoT cloud.

### 4. Analytics

- Analytics is the process of converting analog data from interconnected smart devices and sensors into usable insights that can be processed, interpreted, and used for detailed analysis. 
- Intelligent analytics is a must for IoT technology for management and improvement of the entire system.

### 5. Network Interconnection

- The IoT’s major significant trend in recent years is the explosive growth of devices connected and controlled by the internet. 
- The wide range of applications for IoT technology means that the specifics can be very different from one device to the next, but there are basic characteristics shared by most.

### 6. System Security

- Security is a critical element of IoT deployment, yet it is too often neglected in the development of systems. Everyday vulnerabilities in IoT are being exploited with malicious intent – yet most of them can be prevented simply and cost-effectively.
- A secure system starts with the practice of eradicating vulnerabilities in IoT devices and equipping them with the means to resist, detect and recover from malicious attacks.

### 7. Central Control Hardware

- A Control Panel manages the two-way data traffic between different networks and protocols. Another function of the control panel is to translate different network protocols and make sure interoperability of the connected devices and sensors.
