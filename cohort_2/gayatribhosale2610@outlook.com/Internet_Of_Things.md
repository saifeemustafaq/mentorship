## What is IOT?

The Internet of things ( IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, 
and connectivity which enables these things to connect, collect and exchange data.

### Some communication devices in IoT:

- **Sensors:** Devices which converts physical parameters like temperature, motion etc… into the electrical signals .Smart sensors are the indispensable enablers of IoT.
Imagine a scenario of automated monitoring of a farm such that it will just indicate the current situation of crops like “4 crops need water, Now I’m going to pour it” and then it will satisfy the crop’s need.

This wonder is because of the IoT technology behind it,

 1.The temperature sensor connected with plant pot detects the low temperature.
 
 2.Then it triggers the microprocessor platforms such as Raspberry-Pi, Arduino boards.
 
 3.It receives the sensor signals through internet pathways such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.
 
 4.Then it notifies the user and the motion sensor connected to the tap which turns on to pour it.

- **Actuators:** Devices which is a contrast to sensors. It transforms electrical signals into physical movements. Both sensors and actuators are transducers which converts one form of energy to other. Exchange of datais the most important key factor in IoT. Hence sensors and actuators play a vital role here.

- **RFID Tags:** Wireless microchips used for automatic unique identification of anything by tagging it over them. You have been seen it in credit cards, automobile ignition keys and so on. Since interconnection of things is the main goal of IoT, the RFID tags get hand shaken with IoT technology and is used to provide the unique id for the connected “things” in IoT.
