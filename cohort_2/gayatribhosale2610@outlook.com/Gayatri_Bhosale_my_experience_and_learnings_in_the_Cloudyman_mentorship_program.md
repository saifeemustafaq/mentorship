# About today's Session
Today I learned about cloud computing.

## What is Cloud Computing ? 

- Cloud computing is an architecture or a platform that permit use of other technologies that can store, retrieve, modify and distribute -the data from hosted servers rather than from individual systems.
- It allows several people to work on the same document in real time. People can save a great deal of time spent in updating, filling, and printing documents.
- It refers to  manipulating, configuring,  and  accessing  the hardware and software resources remotely.
- Cloud computing has become the ideal way to deliver enterprise applications—and the preferred solution for companies extending their infrastructure or launching new innovations.

## Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has three most common types of cloud services to offer. Depending on the needs of users, any type of cloud computing service is used either individually or in combination with others. The following is a brief introduction to the three cloud service types, namely, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

## Affect of Cloud on Human Lives

- The application became cheaper, easier to find, and use.

- The new application becomes more comfortable to develop & create based on a standard modular part.

- Cloud will provide new social services by connecting through social networks.

- Lessen the usage of proprietary operating systems in our daily computing.

- Connection to the cloud can be done whenever we want.

## About Virtual Machine

A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.Virtual machines are implemented by software emulation methods or hardware virtualization techniques. A lightweight software known as hypervisor allocates the computing resources (RAM, CPU power, memory, storage, etc.) of the server or host to each VM, keeping all of them separate to avoid interference.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing 

### Cost Savings
Cost saving is the biggest benefit of cloud computing.The services are free from capital expenditure. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. 

### Security
Cloud computing offers great security when any sensitive data has been lost. As the data is stored in the system, it can be easily accessed even if something happens to your computer. You can even remotely wipe out data from the lost machines for avoiding it getting in the wrong hands.

### Flexibility
It offers flexible facility which could be turned off, up or down as per the circumstances of the user. For instance, a promotion of sales is very popular, capacity can be immediately and quickly added to it for the avoidance of losing sales and crashing servers. When those sales are done, the capacity can also be shrunk for the reduction of costs.

### Mobility
Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers.

### Microsoft Azure

- Microsoft Azure is a cloud solution introduced by the Microsoft to ensure the enterprises create, deploy and manage their business in a most effective manner through accessing the data centers across the world.

- The Azure Service Platform is a big part of Microsoft’s cloud computing initiatives. It is designed specifically for the cloud.

- Microsoft Azure includes Windows Azure, which is a cloud specific OS designed to provide scalable compute and storage services. It is supported by Azure App Fabric, which is a collection of different tools for supporting applications in the cloud. SQL Azure enables storage, as well as management of data, similar to the conventional relational database services of an SQL server.

- From developers to business analytics, all are having the opportunity to work on this.

- Irrespective of the size of the company, Azure can be implemented in different sectors of business.

#### Azure provides different services and is mainly categorized under:

- Compute
- Storage
- Network
- Database


It is a platform as a service (PaaS) solution for building and hosting solutions using Microsoft’s products and in their data centers. It is a comprehensive suite of cloud products that allow users to create enterprise-class applications without having to build out their own infrastructure.
 
### Microsoft Azure Server types:
Microsoft Azure  also provides VHDs for different editions and configurations of Windows Server, Linux servers (Suse, Ubuntu, CentOS), Microsoft applications such as SQL Server, BizTalk Server, SharePoint Server, and many third-party applications. Every VM that you create is associated with a cloud service.

### Overview of virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure:

- Microsoft Azure provides three services to run workloads in virtual machines. 
- Deciding whether you need to select Azure Websites, Azure Cloud Services, or Azure Virtual Machines depends on two basic factors: the  type of workload that you want to run in the cloud and the level of control that you need over the VMs that run your workloads.
- Azure Websites support running websites and web applications with a minimal level of VM control and management. 
- Azure Cloud Services allow you to install software and remotely access VMs running your workloads but without the need to fully manage the VMs. 
- Azure Virtual Machines provide you with full control and management over the VMs including updating and patching the operating system and applications. 
- It  provide two tiers of VMs (basic and standard) and different VM sizes (A, D, DS, and G series) to match to your workload requirements. 

### Advantages of Microsoft Azure:

1. Microsoft Azure offers high availability.
2. It offers you a strong security profile.
3. Azure offers good scalability options.
4. It is a cost-effective solution for an IT budget.
5. There are multiple redundancies in place to maintain data access.
6. Azure allows you to use any framework, language, or tool.
7. You are given access to app connectors within the Microsoft family of products.
8. You can automate many of your repetitive tasks.
9. Azure allows businesses to build a hybrid infrastructure.
10. You have access to a rich set of artificial intelligence services.

### Disadvantages of Microsoft Azure:

1. You’ll need to manage Azure to make it effect.
2. You must have platform expertise available.
3. Speed can be an issue for some businesses.
4. The ease of access may be problematic for some businesses.

## What is Capital Expenditure(CapEx) versus Operational Expenditure (OpEx)?

### Capital Expenditure(CapEx):

Capital expenditures are not fully deducted in the accounting period they were incurred. In other words, they are not fully subtracted from the revenue when computing the profits or losses a business has made. However, intangible assets are amortized over their lifespan while the tangible ones are depreciated over their life cycle. All monies spent to get new inventory, including machinery or intellectual property, are grouped under CapEx spendings.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx):

Operating expenses are fully deducted in the accounting period they were incurred. All funds spent when converting inventory into throughput falls under OpEx. This includes employee wages, repair and maintenance of equipment, rental fees, and utility bills and so on. If a business invests in real estate, these spending is approved as CapEx budget and the expense is grouped under CapEx. However, all the costs incurred when managing such an income generating building falls under OpEx.


### Difference between CAPEX and OPEX

- The distinction between CAPEX and OPEX has become very complicated today especially in companies where products and services are driven by knowledge workers.

- In general, CAPEX is what needs to be avoided, while OPEX is something to be kept under tight control.

- CAPEX can be financed externally. But these investors are interested in interest payments and getting their money back in the end. It is riskier with equity financiers as they want it all. You are in essence promising the investor entire cash flow of future. CAPEX eventually depreciates and all that is left is cash flow.

- OPEX can be considered to be (in) efficiency of any business. It has a direct relation with the value of the business. If you can reduce OPEX without hurting day to day operations, you eventually increase valuation of any business.

- When you fire a few people who were inefficient, you are bringing down OPEX and thus increasing the value of business.


## What are the Cloud Deployment models?

### Deployment Models:

The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

### Types Of Cloud Deployment Models:

### Public Cloud:

Public Cloud is a type of cloud hosting that allows the accessibility of systems & its services to its clients/users easily. Some of the examples of those companies which provide public cloud facilities are IBM, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. This cloud service is open for use. This type of cloud computing is a true specimen of cloud hosting where the service providers render services to various clients. From the technical point of view, there is the least difference between private clouds and public clouds along with the structural design. Only the security level depends based on the service providers and the type of cloud clients use. Public cloud is better suited for business purposes for managing the load. This type of cloud is economical due to the decrease in capital overheads.

### Private Cloud:
Private Cloud also termed as 'Internal Cloud'; which allows the accessibility of systems and services within a specific boundary or organization. The cloud platform is implemented in a cloud-based secure environment that is guarded by advanced firewalls under the surveillance of the IT department that belongs to a particular organization. Private clouds permit only authorized users, providing the organizations greater control over data and its security. Business organizations that have dynamic, critical, secured, management demand based requirement should adopt Private Cloud.

#### The advantages of using a private cloud are:

- Highly private and secured: Private cloud resource sharing is highly secured.
- Control Oriented: Private clouds provide more control over its resources than public cloud as it can be accessed within the organization's boundary.

#### The Private cloud has the following disadvantages:

- Poor scalability:  Private type of clouds is scaled within internal limited hosted resources.
- Costly:            As it provides secured and more features, so it's more expensive than a public cloud.
- Pricing:           is inflexible; i.e., purchasing new hardware for up-gradation is more costly.
- Restriction:       It can be accessed locally within an organization and is difficult to expose globally.

### Hybrid Cloud:
Hybrid Cloud is another cloud computing type, which is integrated, i.e., it can be a combination of two or more cloud servers, i.e., private, public or community combined as one architecture, but remain individual entities. Non-critical tasks such as development and test workloads can be done using public cloud whereas critical tasks that are sensitive such as organization data handling are done using a private cloud. Benefits of both deployment models, as well as a community deployment model, are possible in a hybrid cloud hosting. It can cross isolation and overcome boundaries by the provider; hence, it cannot be simply categorized into any of the three deployments - public, private or community cloud.

#### Advantages of Hybrid Cloud Computing are:

- Flexible
- Secure
- Cost Effective
- Rich Scalable

#### Disadvantages of Hybrid Cloud are:

- Complex networking problem
- Organization's security Compliance

### Community Cloud:

Community Cloud is another type of cloud computing in which the setup of the cloud is shared manually among different organizations that belong to the same community or area. Example of such a community is where organizations/firms are there along with the financial institutions/banks. A multi-tenant setup developed using cloud among different organizations that belong to a particular community or group having similar computing concern.
