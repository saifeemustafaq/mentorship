# About today's Session
Today I learned about cloud computing.

## What is Cloud Computing ? 

- Cloud computing is an architecture or a platform that permit use of other technologies that can store, retrieve, modify and distribute -the data from hosted servers rather than from individual systems.
- It allows several people to work on the same document in real time. People can save a great deal of time spent in updating, filling, and printing documents.
- It refers to  manipulating, configuring,  and  accessing  the hardware and software resources remotely.
- Cloud computing has become the ideal way to deliver enterprise applications—and the preferred solution for companies extending their infrastructure or launching new innovations.

## Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has three most common types of cloud services to offer. Depending on the needs of users, any type of cloud computing service is used either individually or in combination with others. The following is a brief introduction to the three cloud service types, namely, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

## Affect of Cloud on Human Lives

- The application became cheaper, easier to find, and use.

- The new application becomes more comfortable to develop & create based on a standard modular part.

- Cloud will provide new social services by connecting through social networks.

- Lessen the usage of proprietary operating systems in our daily computing.

- Connection to the cloud can be done whenever we want.

## About Virtual Machine

A virtual machine (VM) is a software program or operating system that not only exhibits the behavior of a separate computer, but is also capable of performing tasks such as running applications and programs like a separate computer.Virtual machines are implemented by software emulation methods or hardware virtualization techniques. A lightweight software known as hypervisor allocates the computing resources (RAM, CPU power, memory, storage, etc.) of the server or host to each VM, keeping all of them separate to avoid interference.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing 

### Cost Savings
Cost saving is the biggest benefit of cloud computing.The services are free from capital expenditure. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. 

### Security
Cloud computing offers great security when any sensitive data has been lost. As the data is stored in the system, it can be easily accessed even if something happens to your computer. You can even remotely wipe out data from the lost machines for avoiding it getting in the wrong hands.

### Flexibility
It offers flexible facility which could be turned off, up or down as per the circumstances of the user. For instance, a promotion of sales is very popular, capacity can be immediately and quickly added to it for the avoidance of losing sales and crashing servers. When those sales are done, the capacity can also be shrunk for the reduction of costs.

### Mobility
Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers.

## What is Capital Expenditure(CapEx) versus Operational Expenditure (OpEx)?

### Capital Expenditure(CapEx):

Capital expenditures are not fully deducted in the accounting period they were incurred. In other words, they are not fully subtracted from the revenue when computing the profits or losses a business has made. However, intangible assets are amortized over their lifespan while the tangible ones are depreciated over their life cycle. All monies spent to get new inventory, including machinery or intellectual property, are grouped under CapEx spendings.

### Operational Expenditure (OpEx):

Operating expenses are fully deducted in the accounting period they were incurred. All funds spent when converting inventory into throughput falls under OpEx. This includes employee wages, repair and maintenance of equipment, rental fees, and utility bills and so on. If a business invests in real estate, these spending is approved as CapEx budget and the expense is grouped under CapEx. However, all the costs incurred when managing such an income generating building falls under OpEx.


### Difference between CAPEX and OPEX

- The distinction between CAPEX and OPEX has become very complicated today especially in companies where products and services are driven by knowledge workers.

- In general, CAPEX is what needs to be avoided, while OPEX is something to be kept under tight control.

- CAPEX can be financed externally. But these investors are interested in interest payments and getting their money back in the end. It is riskier with equity financiers as they want it all. You are in essence promising the investor entire cash flow of future. CAPEX eventually depreciates and all that is left is cash flow.

- OPEX can be considered to be (in) efficiency of any business. It has a direct relation with the value of the business. If you can reduce OPEX without hurting day to day operations, you eventually increase valuation of any business.

- When you fire a few people who were inefficient, you are bringing down OPEX and thus increasing the value of business.

## What are the Cloud Deployment models?

### Deployment Models:

The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

### Types Of Cloud Deployment Models:

### Public Cloud:

Public Cloud is a type of cloud hosting that allows the accessibility of systems & its services to its clients/users easily. Some of the examples of those companies which provide public cloud facilities are IBM, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc. This cloud service is open for use. This type of cloud computing is a true specimen of cloud hosting where the service providers render services to various clients. From the technical point of view, there is the least difference between private clouds and public clouds along with the structural design. Only the security level depends based on the service providers and the type of cloud clients use. Public cloud is better suited for business purposes for managing the load. This type of cloud is economical due to the decrease in capital overheads.

### Private Cloud:
Private Cloud also termed as 'Internal Cloud'; which allows the accessibility of systems and services within a specific boundary or organization. The cloud platform is implemented in a cloud-based secure environment that is guarded by advanced firewalls under the surveillance of the IT department that belongs to a particular organization. Private clouds permit only authorized users, providing the organizations greater control over data and its security. Business organizations that have dynamic, critical, secured, management demand based requirement should adopt Private Cloud.

#### The advantages of using a private cloud are:

- Highly private and secured: Private cloud resource sharing is highly secured.
- Control Oriented: Private clouds provide more control over its resources than public cloud as it can be accessed within the organization's boundary.

#### The Private cloud has the following disadvantages:

- Poor scalability:  Private type of clouds is scaled within internal limited hosted resources.
- Costly:            As it provides secured and more features, so it's more expensive than a public cloud.
- Pricing:           is inflexible; i.e., purchasing new hardware for up-gradation is more costly.
- Restriction:       It can be accessed locally within an organization and is difficult to expose globally.

### Hybrid Cloud:
Hybrid Cloud is another cloud computing type, which is integrated, i.e., it can be a combination of two or more cloud servers, i.e., private, public or community combined as one architecture, but remain individual entities. Non-critical tasks such as development and test workloads can be done using public cloud whereas critical tasks that are sensitive such as organization data handling are done using a private cloud. Benefits of both deployment models, as well as a community deployment model, are possible in a hybrid cloud hosting. It can cross isolation and overcome boundaries by the provider; hence, it cannot be simply categorized into any of the three deployments - public, private or community cloud.

#### Advantages of Hybrid Cloud Computing are:

- Flexible
- Secure
- Cost Effective
- Rich Scalable

#### Disadvantages of Hybrid Cloud are:

- Complex networking problem
- Organization's security Compliance

### Community Cloud:

Community Cloud is another type of cloud computing in which the setup of the cloud is shared manually among different organizations that belong to the same community or area. Example of such a community is where organizations/firms are there along with the financial institutions/banks. A multi-tenant setup developed using cloud among different organizations that belong to a particular community or group having similar computing concern.

# What is Cloud storage?

With the increasing information that we humans access , the storage requirements to accumulate that information keeps on increasing , May it be a collection of doc files or some movies or some softwares or some songs, the data requirements keeps on increasing day by day. What here is more important is that how we access the big data whether it is for the personal use or professional use. People either prefer upgrading their hard drives or even sometimes prefer using compact disks as well, but with the advancement in technology everyone wants access to data on the go, without having the need to carry physical hardware and hence Cloud Storage requirements fall into place.

## Classification of  Cloud Storage:

Cloud storage can be classified into four types :

- **Personal / Mobile Cloud Storage :** This is a type of cloud of type of cloud storage that we use in our daily lifes, We use android and I-phone these days, for our safety we have already synced our phones online so that even if our phone is lost , we can backup it on the new device anytime as per our convenience. Let’s consider the use case study of i-cloud , the I phone cloud storage platform, that’s what is a personal cloud storage.

- **Publicly Available Cloud Storage :** In this type, the user uses a public-ally available cloud which he has either rented or subscribed for a certain period of time. Anyone with access to that cloud with the User’s log in credentials could access that data from any part of the world.

- **Privately Available cloud storage :** The company providing cloud storage services sets up the data center in the user’s allocated space. The main reason behind having a privately available cloud storage is the requirement of a secure platform and restricted access to the data.

- **A hybrid available cloud storage :** In this case the data is available public-ally but some parts of the data is private and hence is restricted to some users only. So this is an On and off model where it can be switched from public to private or private to public anytime as per user’s convenience.

# What is Latency?

- Cloud service latency is the delay between a client request and a cloud service provider’s response.

- Latency greatly affects how usable and enjoyable devices and communications are. Those problems can be magnified for cloud service communications, which can be especially prone to latency for a number of reasons.

- Many factors affect latency, such as the standard number of router hops or ground-to-satellite communication hops on the way to the target server.  Because cloud service data centers can be physically located anywhere in the world, a customer may want to find out the geographic location.

- Latency in data exchanges between cloud services across the Internet can be much higher. This delay can result in higher costs to users of multiple cloud services, which may mean that an organization is effectively locked into a single provider’s solutions.

## Cloud Latency Issues

### Given below five layers of complexity which affects on cloud latency:

- **Distributed computing** is one component adding to cloud latency’s complexity. With enterprise data centers a thing of the past, the nature of applications has completely changed from being contained within a local infrastructure to being distributed all over the world. The proliferation of Big Data applications using tools such as R and Hadoop are incentivizing distributed computing even more. The problem lies in the fact that these applications, which are deployed all over the world, have varying degrees of latency with each of their Internet connections. Furthermore, latencies are entirely dependent on Internet traffic, which waxes and wanes to compete for the same bandwidth and infrastructure.

- **Virtualization** adds another layer of complexity to latency in the cloud. Gone are the days of rack-mounted servers; enterprises are building virtualized environments for consolidation and cost efficiency, and today’s data centers are now a complex web of hypervisors running dozens of virtual machines. Unfortunately, virtualized network infrastructure can introduce its own series of packet delays before the data even leaves the rack itself

- Another complexity layer lies in the **lack of measurement tools** for modern applications. While ping and traceroute can be used to test Internet connection, modern applications don’t have anything to do with ICMP, the protocol behind these tracing devices. Instead, modern applications and networks use other protocols such as HTTP and FTP and therefore need to try to measure their performances accordingly.

- **Prioritizing traffic and Quality of Service (QoS)** delve deeper into cloud latency’s complexity. Pre-cloud, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and QoS were created to prioritize traffic and to make sure that latency-sensitive applications would have the network resources to run properly. However, cloud and virtualized services make this a dated process, given that we need to now differentiate between certain items like an outage in a server, a network card, a piece of the storage infrastructure, or a security exploit.

- **Evasive cloud providers**, who sometimes neglect to inform you about where their cloud data centers are located, can also complicate latency.

Despite latency’s complexity, it provides a great opportunity for innovative cloud-based solutions, such as the Radar benchmarking tool from Cedexis, which provides insight into what goes on across various IaaS providers, as well as tools like Gomez, which are helpful in comparing providers. While tools are of course helpful in providing insight on trends, the overarching solution to measuring and mitigating cloud latency is providing more consistent network connections.
