## What Is Cloud Computing? How Does ‘The Cloud’ Work?

<p> The term “cloud” when talking about technology or computing, is not new. In simple terms, ‘cloud’ is a metaphor for the Internet. In fact, cloud symbols are repeatedly used to depict the Internet on diagrams. If you think of the Internet as a virtual ‘space’ that connects users from all over the globe, it is like a cloud. It shares information by the way of networks.So, if we go back to the question of what cloud computing actually is, it refers to sharing resources, software and information through a network. In this case, via ‘the Internet’ or more correctly, an Internet connection. Information and data is stored on physical or virtual servers, which are maintained and controlled by a cloud computing provider, such as Amazon and their AWS product. As a personal or business cloud computing user, you access your stored information on the ‘cloud’, via an Internet connection.</p>

## What Are The Different Types Of Cloud Computing?
<p>
Cloud computing can mean many different things these days, but there’s three main categories of cloud computing services. You might have heard about these or use them already; Software as a Service (SaaS), for example – Microsoft 365, Platform as a Service (PaaS), example – salesforce.com and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), example – Rackspace.</p>
