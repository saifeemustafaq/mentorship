## Internet of Things (IoT) 

   The Internet of Things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects--"things"-- that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools. With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices today, experts are expecting this number to grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025.

## Why is IoT so important? 

   Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects--kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors--to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things. 

   By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world--and they cooperate. 

## What technologies have made IoT possible? 

   While the idea of IoT has been in existence for a long time, a collection of recent advances in a number of different technologies has made it practical. 

 - **Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology.** Affordable and reliable sensors are making IoT technology possible for more manufacturers. 

 - **Connectivity.** A host of network protocols for the internet has made it easy to connect sensors to the cloud and to other "things" for efficient data transfer. 

 - **Cloud computing platforms.** The increase in the availability of cloud platform enables both businesses and consumers to access the infrastructure they need to scale up without actually having to manage it all. 

 - **Machine learning and analytics.** With advances in machine learning and analytics, along with access to varied and vast amounts of data stored in the cloud, businesses can gather insights faster and more easily. The emergence of these allied technologies continues to push the boundaries of IoT and the data produced by IoT also feeds these technologies. 

 - **Conversational artificial intelligence (AI).** Advances in neutral networks have brought natural-language processing (NLP) to IoT devices (such as digital personal assistants Alexa, Cortana, and Siri) and made them appealing, affordable, and viable for home use. 

## What is Industrial IoT? 

   Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to the application of IoT technology in industrial settings, especially with respect to instrumentation and control of sensors and devices that engage cloud technologies. Recently, industries have used machine-to-machine communication (M2M) to achieve wireless automation and control. But with the emergence of cloud and allied technologies (such as analytics and machine learning), industries can achieve a new automation layer and with it create new revenue and business models. IIoT is sometimes called the fourth wave of the industrial revolution, or industry 4.0.The following are some common uses for IIoT:

 - Smart manufacturing

 - Preventive and predictive maintenance

 - Smart power grids

 - Smart cities

 - Connected and smart logistics

 - Smart digital supply chains

## Unlock Business Value with IoT

   An IoT becomes more widespread in the marketplace, companies are capitalizing on the tremendous business value it can offer. These benefits include:

 - Deriving data-driven insights from IoT data to help better manage the business

 - Increasing productivity and efficiency of business operations

 - Creating new business models and revenue streams

 - Easily and seamlessly connecting the physical business world to the digital world to drive quick time to value

## What are IoT applications? 

### Business-Ready, SaaS IoT Applications

   IoT applications are prebuilt software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications that can analyze and present captured IoT sensor data to business users via dashboards. 

   IoT applications use machine learning algorithms to analyze massive amounts of connected sensors data in the cloud. Using real-time IoT dashboards and alerts, you gain visibility into key performance indicators, statistics for means time between failures, and other information. Machine learning-based algorithms can identify equipment anomalies and send alerts to users and even trigger automated fixes or proactive counter measures. 

   With cloud-based IoT applications, business users can quickly enhance existing processes for supply chains, customer service, human resources, and financial services. There's no need to recreate entire business processes. 

## What are the IoT applications? 

   The ability of IoT provide sensor information as well as enable device-to-device communication is driving a broad set of applications. The following are some of the most popular applications and what they do. 

 - **Create new efficiencies in manufacturing through machine monitoring and product-quality monitoring.** Machines can be continuously monitored and analyzed to make sure they are performing within required tolerances. Products can also be monitored in real time to identify and address quality defects. 

 - **Improve the tracking and "ring-fencing" of physical assets.** Tracking enables businesses to quickly determine asset location. Ring-fencing allows them to make sure that high-value assets are protected from theft and removal. 

 - **Use wearables to monitor human health analytics and environmental conditions.** IoT wearables enable people to better understand their own health and allow physicians to remotely monitor patients. This technology also enables companies to track the health and safety of their employees, which is especially useful for workers employed in hazardous conditions. 
 
 - **Drive efficiencies and new possibilities in existing processes.** One example of this is the use of IoT to increase efficiency and safety in fleet management. Companies can use IoT fleet monitoring to direct trucks, in real time, to improve efficiency. 

 - **Enable business process changes.** An example of this is the use of IoT devices to monitor the health of remote machines and trigger service calls for preventive maintenance. The ability to remotely monitor machines is also enabling new product-as-a-service business models, where customers no longer need to buy a product but instead pay for its usage. 

## What industries can benefit from IoT? 

   Organizations best suited for IoT are those that would benefit from using sensor devices in their business processes. 

   **Manufacturing**
    
   Manufacturing can gain a competitive advantage by using production-line monitoring to enable proactive maintenance on equipment when sensors detect an impending failure. Sensors can actually measure when production output is compromised. With the help of sensor alerts, manufacturers can quickly check equipment for accuracy or remove it from production until it is repaired. This allows companies to reduce operating costs, get better uptime, and improve asset performance management. 

   **Automotive**

   The automotive industry stands to realize significant advantages from the use of IoT applications. In addition to the benefits of applying IoT to production lines, sensors can detect impending equipment failure in vehicles already on the road and can alert the driver with details and recommendations. Thanks to aggregated information gathered by IoT based applications, automotive manufacturers and suppliers can learn mire about how to keep cars running and car owners informed. 

   **Transportation and Logistics**

   Transportation and logistical systems benefit from a variety of IoT applications. Fleets of cars, trucks, ships, and trains that carry inventory can be rerouted based on weather conditions, vehicle availability, or driver availability, thanks to IoT sensor data. The inventory itself could also be equipped with sensors for track-and-trace temperature control monitoring. The food and beverage, flower, and pharmaceutical industries often carry temperature-sensitive inventory that would benefit greatly from IoT monitoring applications that send alerts when temperatures rise or fall to a level that threatens the product. 

   **Retail**

   IoT applications allow retail companies to manage inventory, improve customer experience, optimize supply chain, and reduce operational costs. For example, smart shelves fitted with weight sensors can collect RFID-based information and send the data to the IoT platform to automatically monitor inventory and trigger alerts if items are running low. Beacons can push targeted offers and promotions to customers to provide an engaging experience. 

   **Public Sector** 

   The benefits of IoT in the public sector and other service-related environments are similarly wide-ranging. For example, government-owned utilities can use IoT-based applications to notify their users of mass outages and even of smaller interruptions of water, power, or sewer services. IoT applications can collect data concerning the scope of an outage and deploy resources to help utilities recover from outages with greater speed. 

   **Healthcare**

   IoT asset monitoring provides multiple benefits to the healthcare industry. Doctors, nurses, and orderlies often need to know the exact location of patient-assistance assets such as wheelchairs. When a hospital's wheelchairs are equipped with IoT sensors, they can be tracked from the IoT asset-monitoring application so that anyone looking for one can quickly find the nearest available wheelchair. Many hospital assets can be tracked this way to ensure proper usage as well as financial accounting for the physical assets in each department. 

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

**Artificial intelligence** (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. 

The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal. 

## Understanding Artificial Intelligence

When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth. 

Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals of artificial intelligence including learning, reasoning, and perception. 

As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function. 

AI is continuously evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based in mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more. 

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence

The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room. 

Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars. Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision. 

Artificial intelligence also has applications in financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large amount deposits, all of which help a bank's fraud department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making supply, denand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.

## Special Considerations

Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning themselves at an exponential rate.

Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized. Other arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems such as robots should be treated with the same rights as humans.

Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would cause the least amount of damage.

Another contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect human employment. With many industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share problems, while manufacturers may easily replace human labour with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.

>## Key Takeaways

 - Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.

 - The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.

 - AI is being used across different industries including finance and healthcare.

 - Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like.

## Categorization of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong. **Weak artificial intelligence** embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.

**Strong artificial intelligence** systems are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. These tend to be more programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kind of systems can be found in applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.
