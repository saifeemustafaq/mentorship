# What is Cloud Computing? 

 - If you're unsure about what Cloud Computing is, you are probably among the 95% of people that are already using cloud services, like online banking and social networks, but don't realise it.

 - The "cloud" is a set of different types of hardware and software that work collectively to deliver many aspects of computing to the end-user as an online service. 

 - Cloud Computing is the use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network (typically the Internet). With cloud computing, users can access files and use applications from any device that can access the Internet.

 - An example of a Cloud Computing provider is Google's and Gmail. Gmail users can access files and applications hosted by Google via the internet from any device. 

# How is computing from the Cloud different from computing from my PC's hard drive? 

 - Unlike traditional computing where data is stored on your PC's local hard drive, the data in the cloud is stored on many physical and/or virtual servers that are hosted by a third-party service provider. An example of a cloud computing file storage provider is Dropbox. Dropbox files can be accessed from any device via the Internet. 

# What are public and private Clouds? 

 - A Public Cloud is based on the standard cloud computing framework which consists of files, applications, storage and services available to the public via the internet. Gmail is an example of a Public Cloud. 

 - A Private Cloud is comprised of files, applications, storage and services that are implemented and protected within a corporate firewall, under the control of a corporate IT department. An example of Private Cloud would be a company that uses Microsoft Exchange because Microsoft Exchange can only be accessed by an authorized user through a secure VPN connection. 

# What are some common Cloud services and companies? 

 - Some common services that are hosted in the cloud are hosted desktop, provided by companies like AT&T; hosted email like Gmail, provided by companies like Google; cloud storage, provided by companies like Dropbox; and streaming music, provided by companies like Spotify. These services, applications and files are stored in the cloud and can be accessed by users via any device. 
 
 - There are a wide range of companies and industry verticals that use cloud computing such as Amazon and Google. Small, medium, and large size public and private companies alike use cloud computing to reduce technology acquisition costs. 

# Do I need Cloud computing? 

 - The Cloud Computing market continues to grow year after year because companies are becoming more aware of the cost saving benefits of adopting the cloud. 

 - With Hardware services, companies are able to use the cloud service provider and are made available over a network saving costly deployment and maintenance costs. 

# Are my files safe in the Cloud? 

 - While no storage solution is 100% safe, cloud storage providers can offer a safer and more accessible place for companies to store data than traditional computing methods. 

 - Depending on the service contract, duplicate copies of the companies' data can be stored on the servers located in different geographies and protected by backup power supplies in the case of disaster. 

 - Today, many companies are moving to Hybrid Cloud Computing model. With this model, companies are given the flexibility of storing sensitive data securely in a private cloud whlie storing public data in a public cloud. Both infrastructures are kept as seperate, unique entities. 

# What the Cloud is NOT? 

 - The cloud is not a fluffy white mass made up of tiny water droplets floating in cyber space. The cloud is not impacted by weather changes like barometric pressure. 

 - The cloud is not a place in a single location. In fact, the cloud can be anywhere. The cloud can be in your companies data center or hosted at a third-party data center. 

 - The growth of the cloud is not being driven by "big business." The growth of the cloud is being driven by consumers buying cloud ready devices that can connect to cloud computing services at work, at home, and on-the-go. 

 - The cloud is not "a fad." There are currently 1.2 billion people using Facebook worldwide. That number represents 11% of the world's population.

# Introduction to Github

  Github is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. 

# What is Version Control? 

 - Version Control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project's code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress... 

 - At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn't be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the "official" source code. 

 - Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging. 

 - With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project. 

 - Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge that code to make it official. 

 - All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be. 

# What is Git? 

 - Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

 - Specifically, Git is distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer's computer, which allows for easy branching and merging. 
 
# Fork in Git
 
 - A fork is a copy of repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. 

# Star in Git

 - Starring makes it easy to find a repository or topic again later. You can see all the repositories and topics you have starred by going to your stars page. 

 - Starring a repository also shows appreciation to the repository maintainer for their work. Many of Github's repository rankings depend on the number of stars a repository has. 

# Watch in Git

  By enabling watch in git, notifications will be received by the owner for all the ongoing activities. 

# Pull request in Git

  A pull request is basically asking the person in charge of the branch to include your code. And it also helps that person see exactly what you've changed in the code. Once some changes made, you could submit that code back to a branch by making a pull request. 

# Markdown Language

   Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lusts are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
   Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

   Markdown is used in following places:

 - Git

 - Comments in Issues and Pull Requests

 - Files with the .md or.markdown extension

   Disaster Recovery
 
   CapEx and OpEx 

# Disaster Recovery in Cloud Computing

 - Data is the most valuable asset. Its loss can result in massive damage to your business, even the loss of reputation. 

 - It is hard to predict when a disaster will occur and how serious its impact will be. 

 - Cloud disaster recovery stores the system data on a remote cloud-based platform. 

 - With disaster recovery in cloud computing, you get access to cloud storage, which can be used as a secondary recovery site. 

 - You can always have a backup copy, even if one of the cloud data centers fails. 

 - State-of-the-art network infrastructure of the cloud provider ensures that there are'nt any issues or errors. 

# Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) 

- Understanding CapEx:

1. Capital Expenditures are equipments or services that are bought to improve or support a company's performance in the future. For example: A production house buys camera's, photostudios, shooting equipments. This becomes the capital expenditure spent by the production house. 

2. The expenses made should profit the company in the future. 

3. The expenses become fixed assets and the value depreciates with time. 

4. There's only little guarantee that the investment activities brings success to the company in its useful life period. 

5. Capital Expenditures (CapEx) are a company's major, longterm investments.

- Understanding OpEx:

1.Operating expenses are the costs of a company incurs for running day-to-day operations. 

2.These are examples of operating expenses: rent and utilities. 

3.The goal of any company is to maximize profits in near future as compare to CapEx. 

4.If the company is unsure of it's future, it won't risk a hefty amount of debt upon itself and the company will choose to rent a piece of equipment instead of purchasing.
