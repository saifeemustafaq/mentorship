# 1. Introduction to *Cloud Computing*.

#### Cloud Computing is basically storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive and you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks.

#  2. Features of *Cloud Computing* .
#### Cloud Computing is perhaps the most useful technological innovation of the 21st century. This is because it has seen the fastest adoption into the mainstream than any other technology in the domain. This adoption has been fueled mainly by the ever-increasing number of smartphones and mobile devices that can access the internet. Cloud computing is not just for organizations and businesses it’s also useful for the average person as well. It enables us to run software programs without installing them on our computers it enables us to store and access our multimedia content via the internet, It enables us to develop and test programs without necessarily having servers and so on. Cloud computing is a 21st-century marvel that holds its importance in almost every field you can think of.

# 3.Introduction to github and benefits of using github.
#### GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration. The service is able to do this by using git, a revision control system that runs in the command line interface.
#### Benefits of using Github:

•GitHub provides developers and researchers with a dynamic and collaborative environment, often referred to as a social coding platform, that supports peer review, commenting, and discussion.

•GitHub is a very versatile tool to use. It is ideal for working on projects of any size and it is an amazing tool for web workflows.

# 4.Basics of Markdown language .
#### Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. 

# 5.Importance of technical documentation .
#### Importance of technical documentation Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on something currently and meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to access information without chasing their managers.
