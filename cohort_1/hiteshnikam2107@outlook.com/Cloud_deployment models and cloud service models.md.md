> # Cloud deployment models :
## Cloud deployment models indicate how the cloud services are made available to users. The four deployment models associated with cloud computing are as follows:

# Private Cloud:
It is a cloud-based infrastructure used by stand-alone organizations. It offers greater control over security. The data is backed up by a firewall and internally, and can be hosted internally or externally. Private clouds are perfect for organizations that have high-security requirements, high management demands, and availability requirements.

# Public Cloud:
This type of cloud services is provided on a network for public use. Customers have no control over the location of the infrastructure. It is based on a shared cost model for all the users, or in the form of a licensing policy such as pay per user. Public deployment models in the cloud are perfect for organizations with growing and fluctuating demands. It is also popular among businesses of all sizes for their web applications, webmail, and storage of non-sensitive data.

# Community Cloud:
It is a mutually shared model between organizations that belong to a particular community such as banks, government organizations, or commercial enterprises. Community members generally share similar issues of privacy, performance, and security. This type of deployment model of cloud computing is managed and hosted internally or by a third-party vendor.

# Hybrid Cloud:
This model incorporates the best of both private and public clouds, but each can remain as separate entities. Further, as part of this deployment of cloud computing model, the internal, or external providers can provide resources. A hybrid cloud is ideal for scalability, flexibility, and security. A perfect example of this scenario would be that of an organization who uses the private cloud to secure their data and interacts with its customers using the public cloud.

> Cloud Deployment Services :
# 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
# 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
# 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
 
 - ## Any Virtual machine comprises of three things, i.e. infrastructure(the actual hardware), the platform( the operating system) which will work on the infrastructure and the software which will work on the hardware and the operating system
- ## A user has to sort his requirements according to these three categories.
- ## He has to figure what infrastructure he will need, what operating system and what softwares he'd require.
- ## Various cloud providers provide different services which are mentioned down.

## IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
- Infrastructure is the actual hardware of any machine.
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) only deals with the infrastructure that should be provided.
- Rest everything will be checked by the consumer.
- If someone opts for IaaS, he will be provided with the necessary Hardware specifications he demanded. 
- He has to then deploy the platfrom he'll need and also the software's he needs.
- It provides better flexibility as the hardware resources can be tailored according to your needs.
- This cloud computing service model is ideal for large organizations capable of building and managing their platforms(operating systems).

- #### example of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) providers:
 - amazon web services
 - Microsoft Azure
 
## PaaS (Platform as a Service):
- PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a service that looks for the infrastructure and the platform that the consumer wants.
- Only thing that the consumer has to look for is the software he needs.
- The organisation has to deploy the softwares on the VM by themselves.
- One can Master the installation and development of software applications with the help of PaaS.
- There is no need to manage the platform or hardware.

#### example of PaaS (Platform as a Service) providers:

- Google cloud platform.
- Microsoft Azure

## SaaS (Software as a Service):
- Software as a Service (SaaS) is requires no installation of any softwares or deployment of any platforms. 
- Consumers are free from the infrastructure and software installation or software maintenance.
- Automatic updates of the softwares is a advantage.
- It makes easier for testing of new softwares.

#### example of  SaaS (Software as a Service) providers:

- Microsoft Azure 
- Oracle
