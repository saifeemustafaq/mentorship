# What is *cloud computing*?
#### • Cloud computing is a term used to describe the use of hardware and software delivered via network (usually the Internet). 
#### • Simply put, cloud computing is computing based on the internet. In the past, people would run applications or programs from software downloaded on a physical computer or server in their building. Cloud computing allows people access to the same kinds of applications through the internet.

# Why we use *cloud computing*?
#### 1.Efficiency
**By using cloud infrastructure, you don't have to spend huge amounts of money on purchasing and maintaing equipment.
You don’t have to invest in hardware, facilities, utilities, or building out a large data center to grow your business. You do not even need large IT teams to handle your cloud data center operations, as you can enjoy the expertise of your cloud provider’s staff.**

#### 2.Data Security
**One of the major concerns of every business, regardless of size and industry, is the security of its data. Data breaches and other cybercrimes can devastate a company's revenue, customer loyalty and brand positioning.
Cloud offers many advanced security features that guarantee that data is securely stored and handled.**

#### 3. Scalability
 **Cloud based solutions are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your business demands increase, you can easily increase your cloud capacity without having to invest in physical infrastructure. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors.**

#### 4.Mobility
**Cloud computing allows mobile access to corporate data via smartphones and devices, which is a great way to ensure that no one is ever left out of the loop. Staff with busy schedules, or who live a long way away from the corporate office, can use this feature to keep instantly up-to-date with clients and coworkers.**

# What is *GitHub* and why we use *GitHub*?
#### GitHub:
**GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration.**

#### Use of GitHub:
#### 1.Using Github makes it easier to collaborate with colleagues and peers and look back at previous versions of your work.
#### 2.Because GitHub is a repository, it allows your work to get out in front of the public. Moreover, it is one of the largest coding communities around, so using it can provide wide exposure for your project and for you.
#### 3.GitHub also tracks changes in a changelog, so you can know exactly what is changed each time. This feature is especially helpful for looking back in time and quickly identifying changes a collaborator made.
#### 4.GitHub can integrate with common platforms such as Amazon and Google Cloud, as well as services such as Code Climate to track your feedback, and it can highlight syntax in more than 200 different programming languages.

# It is helpful for *interview* and *placement*?
#### Yes.
**Cloud Computing is that tremendous innovation which is changing the way IT solutions are delivered across the digital landscape of India and the world. Cloud is enabling resellers with a lucrative opportunity to capitalize on.
Currently many companies expect you to have  knowledge about particular skills which currently in trend. Having knowledge about cloud computing is indeed gonna help us interview it's higher our chances of getting successful.**

# What are *markup* and *markdown* language?
#### 1.Markup
**In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text.  example Html etc.**

#### 2.Markdown
**Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like "#" or "*".**

# What is a *centralized system*?
####
**• Centralized systems are systems that use client/server architecture where one or more client nodes are directly connected to a central server. This is the most commonly used type of system in many organisations where client sends a request to a company server and receives the response.**
