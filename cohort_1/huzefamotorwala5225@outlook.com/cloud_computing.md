> # what is cloud computing? 
   #### cloud computing is basically storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive and you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks
> # Github and benefits of Github   
   ####  GitHub hosts my source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration and keeps me updated each time a developer makes changes to my program. When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using GitHub web interface.
> # concept of markdown language   
   #### Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents
> # Importance of technical documentation
   #### Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on something currently and meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to access information without chasing their managers.
> # Features of github 
   - #### Development teams everywhere can work together to secure the software supply chain
   - #### Github simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects
   - #### Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit and manage the code files.
     ## ***Repository***
     - #### A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded
     ## ***Fork***
     - #### forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
     ## ***Star***
     - #### Users on the GitHub website are able to ***star*** other people's repositories, thereby saving them in their list of Starred Repos. Some people use ***stars*** to indicate that they like a project, other people use them as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later.
     ## ***Watch***
     - #### When you are watching a project or a person you will receive status updates on their activities. These activities include commits, tagging, repository creation etc.

> # Benefits of cloud computing
- ## COST SAVING
  - #### ***For example***  if I start my own company and hire 10 high-end designers and provide them with high tech computers, then, first of all, it will require a vast investment and secondly, I'm not sure if the designers are best at their job, so it's kind of huge risk. so, what I will do is provide my designers with mid-ranged computers and then I will install a virtual machine in the computers with specifications that can help my designers so what I did is that I took processing power from a cloud vendor on rent as I do not have a high-end processor so that is how I saved my money    
- - -
- ## Security
  - #### ***For example*** if I want security for my computers I will configure the firewall so that nobody hacks into my system secondly I cant request internet company to provide me with a direct connection from their headquarters which is neither possible nor feasible, so what will I do is that I'll call my cloud vendor from whom I have bought the virtual machine to provide me with security and they will bear all the responsibilities so that's how the cloud helps ensure security
- - -
- ## Flexibility
  - #### ***For example*** if I have a presentation in my company and the presentation is stored in my laptop and let's say someone else takes my laptop so what I will do is I will go to my presentation room and open some other laptop and connect it to the virtual machine using the IP address provided by my cloud vendor and I recover my presentation and that's how cloud computing ensures flexibility 
- - - 
- ## Mobility
  - #### ***For example*** if I work on all of my projects in the virtual machine then I do not have to worry about carrying my stuff to everywhere I go rather I just have to remember my IP address provided by my cloud vendor and I can access any of my projects anytime and anywhere. So this is mobility
- - -
- ## Insight
  - #### ***For example*** if I am ill and can't go to work but my work is quite important so I will request my colleague to work on my behalf by providing hin the IP address of my virtual machine so when he connects the IP he gets an insight of what I have been working on. So insight basically means to gain something essential or knowledge about a person or a thing.
- - -
- ## Increased Collaboration
  - #### Now after my colleague have an insight into my project he can tell me about any progress or any faults and error regarding my project and collaborate with me in ongoing as well as future projects and all the members can work simultaneously 
- - -
- ## Quality Control
  - #### I am not working on my project alone I have 3-4 members alongside me who work under my guidance so I am the admin and the Quality control is under my hands and I can easily log in and see which user is working and what he is working on
- - - 
- ## Disaster recovery 
  - #### ***For example*** if I am working on a project and some disaster occurs so because of the virtual machine my project does not get vanished rather as soon as I enter my IP address my project appears as it is. 
  - #### It is hard to predict when a disaster will occur and how serious its impact will be. However, what you can control is the way you respond to a disaster and how successfully your organization will recover from it,
  - #### The primary goal of disaster recovery is to minimize the overall impact of a disaster on business performance. Disaster recovery in cloud computing can do just that. In case of disaster, critical workloads can be failed over to a Data Recovery site in order to resume business operations. As soon as your production data center gets restored, you can fail back from the cloud and restore your infrastructure and its components to their original state. As a result, business downtime is reduced and service disruption is minimized.
- - -
- ## Loss prevention 
  - ## it’s simply a strategy for ensuring the sensitive and protected information does not leave the company network.
- - -
- ## Automatic Software Upadate
  - #### ***For example*** if a software update arrives and you update your smartphone it swithes off and your work vanishes also after an update your smartphone tends to be slower but in cloud computing it will automatically update the software without any repercussion
- - -
- ## Competitive Edge
  - #### Companies who have deployed cloud broadly are gaining competitive advantage over their rivals that have not yet deployed cloud. These pacesetters are re-inventing customer relationships, using analytics extensively to derive insights from big data, sharing data seamlessly, and making data-driven and evidence-based decisions. Most importantly, pacesetters are growing revenue and gross profit faster than other organizations.The ability to analyze big data in cloud systems creates competitive advantage from cloud computing through access and affordability of complex software for small and medium sized enterprises.

> # What is Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)?
  - #### An operating expense (OPEX) is an expense required for the day-to-day functioning of a business. In contrast, a capital expense (CAPEX) is an expense a business incurs to create a benefit in the future. Operating expenses and capital expenses are treated quite differently for accounting and tax purposes.
  - #### ***For example*** if you invest in a new building or a new type of machinery, then this would be considered Capex
  - #### ***For example*** Expenses incurred in operating the firm's core line of business are operating expenses. Employee wages, inventory handling costs, and expenditures for office supplies are operating expenses.

> # What are the Cloud deployment models
  - > ### 1. Public Cloud
    - #### The name speaks for itself: public clouds are available to the general public, and data are created and stored on third-party servers.
  - > ### 2. Private Cloud
    - #### There is little to no difference between a public and a private model from the technical point of view, as their architectures are very similar. However, opposed to a public cloud that is available to the general public, only one specific company owns a private one. That is why it is also called an internal or corporate.
  - > ### 3. Community Cloud
    - #### A community deployment model largely resembles a private one; the only difference is the set of users. While a private type implies that only one company owns the server, in the case of a community one, several organizations with similar backgrounds share the infrastructure and related resources.

> # Types of cloud services
  ## ***Cloud computing*** services fall into 4 categories: ***infrastructure as a service (IaaS)***, ***platform as a service (PaaS)***, ***software as a service (SaaS)*** and ***FaaS (functions as a service)***. These are sometimes called the cloud computing stack, because they build on top of one another.
  - > ### Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
    - #### This service allows you to rent IT infrastructures like servers or virtual machine on a pay-as-you-go basis.
  - > ### Platform as a service (PaaS)
    - #### This service allows you to  to supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. It is designed to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.
  - > ### Software as a service (SaaS)
    - #### This service helps you to deliver software applications over the Internet as per the demand and on a subscription basis. SaaS helps you host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance (software upgrades and security patching).
  - > ### Functions as a service (Faas) 
    - #### This service helps you to upload the blocks of code having specific functionality and set them in such a way that it gets triggered when a certain event occurs 
> # Region and Availability zones
  - #### regions are the geographical location where the public cloud service provider's data centers reside
  - #### Availability zones are isolated location within the data center region from where public cloud service originate and operate
> # What is a region pair?
  - #### region pair consist of two region within the same geography
    - #### An Azure Region Pair is a relationship between 2 Azure Regions within the same geographic region for disaster recovery purposes.

> ## Cloud uptime 
  - #### Cloud uptime is the amount of time that a cloud service hosted by a cloud provider is accessible to end users.
> ## Cloud downtime
  - #### Cloud downtime is the amount of time that a cloud service hosted by a cloud provider are unavailable to end users

> # What is Service Level Agreement(SLA)
  #### A service-level agreement (SLA) defines the level of service you expect from a vendor. Usually, SLAs are between companies and external suppliers, but they may also be between two departments within a company.
  ####  service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and its customers that documents what services the provider will offer and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet.
  #### ***For example*** If I buy an AC from the dealer he will offer me his services like free maintenance for a certain period and replacement policy in case of any damage as well as defines me the standards company should meet
