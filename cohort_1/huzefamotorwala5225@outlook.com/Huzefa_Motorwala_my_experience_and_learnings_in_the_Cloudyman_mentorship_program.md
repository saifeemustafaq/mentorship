## Today I learned:
> # what is cloud computing? 
   #### cloud computing is basically storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive and you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks
> # Github and benefits of Github   
   ####  GitHub hosts my source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration and keeps me updated each time a developer makes changes to my program. When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using GitHub web interface.
> # concept of markdown language   
   #### Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents
> # Importance of technical documentation
   #### Documentation help ensure consent and expectations. Having reliable documentation is crucial in helping users figure out how to use a product as well as aiding writers and developers in creating work of consistent and high quality. Also if you are working on something currently and meanwhile you forget one or the other thing then you can always have a quick look at your documentation and recall evrything. Technical documentation is an asset for your organization, for the simple reason that it enables employees to access information without chasing their managers.
> # Features of github 
   - #### Development teams everywhere can work together to secure the software supply chain
   - #### Github simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects
   - #### Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit and manage the code files.
     ## ***Repository***
     - #### A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded
     ## ***Fork***
     - #### forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
     ## ***Star***
     - #### Users on the GitHub website are able to ***star*** other people's repositories, thereby saving them in their list of Starred Repos. Some people use ***stars*** to indicate that they like a project, other people use them as bookmarks so they can follow what's going on with the repo later.
     ## ***Watch***
     - #### When you are watching a project or a person you will receive status updates on their activities. These activities include commits, tagging, repository creation etc.

> # Benefits of cloud computing
- ## COST SAVING
  - #### ***For example***  if I start my own company and hire 10 high-end designers and provide them with high tech computers, then, first of all, it will require a vast investment and secondly, I'm not sure if the designers are best at their job, so it's kind of huge risk. so, what I will do is provide my designers with mid-ranged computers and then I will install a virtual machine in the computers with specifications that can help my designers so what I did is that I took processing power from a cloud vendor on rent as I do not have a high-end processor so that is how I saved my money
