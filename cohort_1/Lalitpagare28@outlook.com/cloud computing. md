AWS Cloud
Computing
Cloud computing is the on-
demand delivery of compute
power, database storage,
applications, and other IT
resources through a cloud
services platform via the Internet
with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Whether you are running
applications that share photos to
millions of mobile users or you’re
supporting the critical operations
of your business, a cloud services
platform provides rapid access to
flexible and low-cost IT resources.
With cloud computing, you don’t
need to make large upfront
investments in hardware and
spend a lot of time on the heavy
lifting of managing that hardware.
Instead, you can provision exactly
the right type and size of
computing resources you need to
power your newest bright idea or
operate your IT department. You
can access as many resources as
you need, almost instantly, and
only pay for what you use.
Cloud computing provides a
simple way to access servers,
storage, databases and a broad
set of application services over
the Internet. A cloud services
platform such as Amazon Web
Services owns and maintains the
network-connected hardware
required for these application
services, while you provision and
use what you need via a web
application. [1]
What is Cloud Computing?
History
In 2006, Amazon Web Services
(AWS) began offering IT
infrastructure services to
businesses as web services—now
commonly known as cloud
computing. One of the key
benefits of cloud computing is the
opportunity to replace upfront
capital infrastructure expenses
with low variable costs that scale
with your business. With the cloud,
businesses no longer need to plan
for and procure servers and other
IT infrastructure weeks or months
in advance. Instead, they can
instantly spin up hundreds or
thousands of servers in minutes
and deliver results faster.
Today, AWS provides a highly
reliable, scalable, low-cost
infrastructure platform in the cloud
that powers hundreds of
thousands of businesses in 190
countries around the world. [3]
What is AWS?
Cloud benefits
Trade capital expense for
variable expense – Instead of
having to invest heavily in data
centers and servers before you
know how you’re going to use
them, you can pay only when
you consume computing
resources, and pay only for how
much you consume.
Benefit from massive
economies of scale – By using
cloud computing, you can
achieve a lower variable cost
than you can get on your own.
Because usage from hundreds
of thousands of customers is
aggregated in the cloud,
providers such as AWS can
achieve higher economies of
scale, which translates into
lower pay as-you-go prices.
Stop guessing about capacity
– Eliminate guessing on your
infrastructure capacity needs.
When you make a capacity
decision prior to deploying an
application, you often end up
either sitting on expensive idle
resources or dealing with
limited capacity. With cloud
computing, these problems go
away. You can access as much
or as little capacity as you need,
and scale up and down as
required with only a few
minutes’ notice.
Increase speed and agility – In
a cloud computing environment,
new IT resources are only a
click away, which means that
you reduce the time to make
those resources available to
your developers from weeks to
just minutes. This results in a
dramatic increase in agility for
the organization, since the cost
and time it takes to experiment
and develop is significantly
lower.
Stop spending money running
and maintaining data centers
– Focus on projects that
differentiate your business, not
the infrastructure. Cloud
computing lets you focus on
your own customers, rather
than on the heavy lifting of
racking, stacking, and powering
servers.
Go global in minutes – Easily
deploy your application in
multiple regions around the
world with just a few clicks. This
means you can provide lower
latency and a better experience
for your customers at minimal
cost. [4]
Total Cost of
Ownership
AWS helps you reduce Total Cost
of Ownership (TCO) by reducing
the need to invest in large capital
expenditures and providing a pay-
as-you-go model that empowers
you to invest in the capacity you
need and use it only when the
business requires it. Our TCO
calculators allow you to estimate
the cost savings when using AWS
and provide a detailed set of
reports that can be used in
executive presentations. The
calculators also give you the
option to modify assumptions that
best meet your business needs.

The TCO Calculator provides
directional guidance on possible
realized savings when deploying
AWS. This tool is built on an
underlying calculation model, that
generates a fair assessment of
value that a customer may achieve
given the data provided by the
user. This tool is for approximation
purposes only. [8]
Types of cloud
computing
Cloud computing is providing
developers and IT departments
with the ability to focus on what
matters most and avoid
undifferentiated work like
procurement, maintenance, and
capacity planning. As cloud
computing has grown in
popularity, several different
models and deployment strategies
have emerged to help meet
specific needs of different users.
Each type of cloud service, and
deployment method, provides you
with different levels of control,
flexibility, and management.
Understanding the differences
between Infrastructure as a
Service, Platform as a Service,
and Software as a Service, as well
as what deployment strategies you
can use, can help you decide what
set of services is right for your
needs. [5]
IaaS
Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS):
Infrastructure as a Service,
sometimes abbreviated as IaaS,
contains the basic building blocks
for cloud IT and typically provide
access to networking features,
computers (virtual or on dedicated
hardware), and data storage
space. Infrastructure as a Service
provides you with the highest level
of flexibility and management
control over your IT resources and
is most similar to existing IT
resources that many IT
departments and developers are
familiar with today.
PaaS
Platform as a Service (PaaS):
Platforms as a service remove the
need for organizations to manage
the underlying infrastructure
(usually hardware and operating
systems) and allow you to focus
on the deployment and
management of your applications.
This helps you be more efficient
as you don’t need to worry about
resource procurement, capacity
planning, software maintenance,
patching, or any of the other
undifferentiated heavy lifting
involved in running your
application.
SaaS
Software as a Service (SaaS):
Software as a Service provides
you with a completed product that
is run and managed by the service
provider. In most cases, people
referring to Software as a Service
are referring to end-user
applications. With a SaaS offering
you do not have to think about
how the service is maintained or
how the underlying infrastructure
is managed; you only need to
think about how you will use that
particular piece software. A
common example of a SaaS
application is web-based email
where you can send and receive
email without having to manage
feature additions to the email
product or maintaining the servers
and operating systems that the
email program is running on.
Deployment
models
Learn about the key benefits of…

Cloud
A cloud-based application is fully
deployed in the cloud and all parts
of the application run in the cloud.
Applications in the cloud have
either been created in the cloud or
have been migrated from an
existing infrastructure to take
advantage of the benefits of cloud
computing. Cloud-based
applications can be built on low-
level infrastructure pieces or can
use higher level services that
provide abstraction from the
management, architecting, and
scaling requirements of core
infrastructure.
Hybrid
A hybrid deployment is a way to
connect infrastructure and
applications between cloud-based
resources and existing resources
that are not located in the cloud.
The most common method of
hybrid deployment is between the
cloud and existing on-premises
infrastructure to extend, and grow,
an organization's infrastructure
into the cloud while connecting
cloud resources to the internal
system. For more information on
how AWS can help you with your
hybrid deployment, please visit
our hybrid page.
On-premises
The deployment of resources on-
premises, using virtualization and
resource management tools, is
sometimes called the “private
cloud.” On-premises deployment
doesn’t provide many of the
benefits of cloud computing but is
sometimes sought for its ability to
provide dedicated resources. In
most cases this deployment model
is the same as legacy IT
infrastructure while using
application management and
virtualization technologies to try
and increase resource utilization.
[5]
Global
infrastructure
AWS serves over a million active
customers in more than 190
countries. We are steadily
expanding global infrastructure to
help our customers achieve lower
latency and higher throughput,
and to ensure that their data
resides only in the AWS Region
they specify. As our customers
grow their businesses, AWS will
continue to provide infrastructure
that meets their global
requirements.
The AWS Cloud infrastructure is
built around AWS Regions and
Availability Zones. An AWS Region
is a physical location in the world
where we have multiple
Availability Zones. Availability
Zones consist of one or more
discrete data centers, each with
redundant power, networking, and
connectivity, housed in separate
facilities. These Availability Zones
offer you the ability to operate
production applications and
databases that are more highly
available, fault tolerant, and
scalable than would be possible
from a single data center. The
AWS Cloud operates 42
Availability Zones within 16
geographic Regions around the
world, with five more Availability
Zones and two more Regions
coming online in 2017.
Each Amazon Region is designed
to be completely isolated from the
other Amazon Regions. This
achieves the greatest possible
fault tolerance and stability. Each
Availability Zone is isolated, but
the Availability Zones in a Region
are connected through low-
latency links. AWS provides you
with the flexibility to place
instances and store data within
multiple geographic regions as
well as across multiple Availability
Zones within each AWS Region.
Each Availability Zone is designed
as an independent failure zone.
This means that Availability Zones
are physically separated within a
typical metropolitan region and
are located in lower risk flood
plains (specific flood zone
categorization varies by AWS
Region). In addition to discrete
uninterruptable power supply
(UPS) and onsite backup
generation facilities, they are each
fed via different grids from
independent utilities to further
reduce single points of failure.
Availability Zones are all
redundantly connected to multiple
tier-1 transit providers. [6]

Security and
Compliance
Cloud security at AWS is the
highest priority. As an AWS
customer, you will benefit from a
data center and network
architecture built to meet the
requirements of the most security-
sensitive organizations. Security in
the cloud is much like security in
your on-premises data centers—
only without the costs of
maintaining facilities and
hardware. In the cloud, you don’t
have to manage physical servers
or storage devices. Instead, you
use software-based security tools
to monitor and protect the flow of
information into and of out of your
cloud resources.
An advantage of the AWS Cloud is
that it allows you to scale and
innovate, while maintaining a
secure environment and paying
only for the services you use. This
means that you can have the
security you need at a lower cost
than in an on-premises
environment.
As an AWS customer you inherit
all the best practices of AWS
policies, architecture, and
operational processes built to
satisfy the requirements of our
most security-sensitive customers.
Get the flexibility and agility you
need in security controls.
The AWS Cloud enables a shared
responsibility model. While AWS
manages security of the cloud,
you are responsible for security in
the cloud. This means that you
retain control of the security you
choose to implement to protect
your own content, platform,
applications, systems, and
networks no differently than you
would in an on-site data center.
AWS provides you with guidance
and expertise through online
resources, personnel, and
partners. AWS provides you with
advisories for current issues, plus
you have the opportunity to work
with AWS when you encounter
security issues.
You get access to hundreds of
tools and features to help you to
meet your security objectives.
AWS provides security-specific
tools and features across network
security, configuration
management, access control, and
data encryption.
Finally, AWS environments are
continuously audited, with
certifications from accreditation
bodies across geographies and
verticals. In the AWS environment,
you can take advantage of
automated tools for asset
inventory and privileged access
reporting.
Benefits of AWS Security
Keep Your Data Safe: The AWS
infrastructure puts strong
safeguards in place to help
protect your privacy. All data is
stored in highly secure AWS
data centers.
Meet Compliance
Requirements: AWS manages
dozens of compliance programs
in its infrastructure. This means
that segments of your
compliance have already been
completed.
Save Money: Cut costs by
using AWS data centers.
Maintain the highest standard of
security without having to
manage your own facility
Scale Quickly: Security scales
with your AWS Cloud usage. No
matter the size of your business,
the AWS infrastructure is
designed to keep your data
safe. [7]
AWS Cloud Compliance enables
you to understand the robust
controls in place at AWS to
maintain security and data
protection in the cloud. As
systems are built on top of AWS
Cloud infrastructure, compliance
responsibilities will be shared. By
tying together governance-
focused, audit-friendly service
features with applicable
compliance or audit standards,
AWS Compliance enablers build
on traditional programs. This helps
customers to establish and
operate in an AWS security
control environment.
The IT infrastructure that AWS
provides to its customers is
designed and managed in
alignment with best security
practices and a variety of IT
security standards. The following
is a partial list of assurance
programs with which AWS
complies:
SOC 1/ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC
3
FISMA, DIACAP, and FedRAMP
PCI DSS Level 1
ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO
27018
AWS provides customers a wide
range of information on its IT
control environment in
whitepapers, reports,
certifications, accreditations, and
other third-party attestations.
More information is available in
the Risk and Compliance
whitepaper and the AWS Security
Center. [7]
